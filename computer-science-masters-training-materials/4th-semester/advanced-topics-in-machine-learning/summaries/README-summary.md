### Module 1: Foundations of Advanced Machine Learning

**Key Concepts:**
- **Supervised Learning:** Involves learning from labeled data where both the input and corresponding output are provided. Examples include classification and regression tasks.
- **Unsupervised Learning:** Deals with finding patterns or hidden structures in unlabeled data, such as clustering or dimensionality reduction techniques.
- **Reinforcement Learning (RL):** An agent learns by interacting with an environment to maximize cumulative reward over time.

**Mathematical Notation:**
- **Loss Function (L):** The loss function measures the difference between true and predicted values, guiding model optimization.
  \[
  L(y_{\text{true}}, y_{\text{pred}}) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_{\text{true}, i} - y_{\text{pred}, i})^2
  \]

**Pseudo Code for Model Evaluation:**
```
function evaluate_model(y_true, y_pred):
    mean_squared_error = calculate_mean_squared_error(y_true, y_pred)
    root_mean_squared_error = square_root(mean_squared_error)
    r_squared = 1 - (sum_of_squares(y_true - y_pred) / sum_of_squares(y_true - mean(y_true)))
    return root_mean_squared_error, r_squared
end function
```

This pseudo code represents the process of evaluating a machine learning model's performance using common metrics like mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and R-squared.

### Module 2: Deep Learning Architectures

**Key Concepts:**
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):** Used for image classification and object detection. CNNs apply convolution operations to extract spatial features.
- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs):** Suitable for processing sequential data like time series, where past information influences the future.
- **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs):** Consist of two neural networks, the generator and discriminator, which are trained simultaneously to generate realistic data.

**Mathematical Notation:**
- **Convolution Operation:** Defines the mathematical basis for extracting features from images by sliding a filter across the input data.
  \[
  (f * g)(x) = \sum_{a} f(a) g(x - a)
  \]

**Pseudo Code for a Simple CNN:**
```
function simple_cnn(input):
    convolution_layer = apply_convolution(input, filters, kernel_size)
    activation_layer = apply_relu(convolution_layer)
    pooling_layer = apply_max_pooling(activation_layer, pool_size)
    flattened_layer = flatten(pooling_layer)
    output_layer = apply_dense_layer(flattened_layer, number_of_classes)
    return output_layer
end function
```

This illustrates how a basic CNN architecture processes input data through layers of convolution, activation, pooling, and a fully connected layer.

### Module 3: Ensemble Learning Techniques

**Key Concepts:**
- **Random Forests:** Ensemble methods that aggregate multiple decision trees to reduce model variance and improve robustness.
- **Gradient Boosting Machines (GBMs):** Build models sequentially, each one correcting the errors of the previous, making them effective for complex predictive tasks.

**Mathematical Notation:**
- **Random Forest Prediction:** Aggregates predictions from multiple decision trees to produce a final output.
  \[
  \hat{y} = \frac{1}{T} \sum_{t=1}^{T} h_t(x)
  \]

**Pseudo Code for Random Forest Prediction:**
```
function random_forest_predict(X, trees):
    predictions = initialize_empty_list()
    for each tree in trees:
        append(tree_prediction(tree, X), predictions)
    return majority_vote(predictions)
end function
```

This outlines how a random forest model makes predictions by collecting and aggregating outputs from individual decision trees.

### Module 4: Unsupervised Learning Techniques

**Key Concepts:**
- **K-Means Clustering:** Partitions the data into \(k\) clusters by minimizing the variance within each cluster.
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):** Reduces the dimensionality of data by projecting it onto principal components, preserving the most variance.

**Mathematical Notation:**
- **K-Means Objective Function:** Measures the sum of squared distances between data points and their assigned cluster centroids.
  \[
  J = \sum_{i=1}^{k} \sum_{x_j \in C_i} ||x_j - \mu_i||^2
  \]

**Pseudo Code for K-Means Clustering:**
```
function k_means(X, k, max_iterations):
    centroids = initialize_centroids_randomly(X, k)
    for iteration in 1 to max_iterations:
        clusters = assign_points_to_nearest_centroids(X, centroids)
        centroids = update_centroids(clusters)
    return centroids, clusters
end function
```

This explains the iterative process used in K-Means clustering to update centroids and assign points to the nearest clusters.

### Module 5: Reinforcement Learning

**Key Concepts:**
- **Markov Decision Processes (MDP):** Formal framework for modeling sequential decision-making in RL, consisting of states, actions, rewards, and transitions.
- **Q-Learning:** A value-based RL algorithm that updates the action-value function to maximize cumulative future rewards.

**Mathematical Notation:**
- **Q-Learning Update Rule:** Updates the action-value pair based on the agent's experience and future reward estimates.
  \[
  Q(s, a) \leftarrow Q(s, a) + \alpha \left( r + \gamma \max_{a'} Q(s', a') - Q(s, a) \right)
  \]

**Pseudo Code for Q-Learning:**
```
function q_learning(environment, num_episodes, alpha, gamma):
    Q_table = initialize_Q_table()
    for episode in 1 to num_episodes:
        state = environment_reset()
        while not done:
            action = choose_action_from_Q(Q_table, state)
            next_state, reward, done = environment_step(action)
            Q_table[state, action] = Q_table[state, action] + alpha * (reward + gamma * max_Q_value(Q_table, next_state) - Q_table[state, action])
            state = next_state
    return Q_table
end function
```

This pseudo code represents the core logic of Q-learning, where the agent iteratively updates its action-value estimates based on its experience interacting with the environment.

### Module 6: Ethical Considerations in Machine Learning

**Key Concepts:**
- **Bias in Data:** Machine learning models can reflect and even amplify biases present in the training data, leading to unfair outcomes.
- **Fairness Metrics:** Techniques like demographic parity and equalized odds ensure fairness across different demographic groups, ensuring ML systems operate equitably.

**Mathematical Notation:**
- **Demographic Parity:** Ensures that the likelihood of positive outcomes is equal across protected groups.
  \[
  P(\hat{Y} = 1 | A = 1) = P(\hat{Y} = 1 | A = 0)
  \]

**Pseudo Code for Fairness Check:**
```
function check_demographic_parity(y_pred, protected_attribute):
    parity = initialize_empty_dict()
    for value in unique(protected_attribute):
        parity[value] = proportion_of_positive_predictions(y_pred, protected_attribute == value)
    return parity
end function
```

This demonstrates how a fairness check can be implemented to measure demographic parity across different protected attributes.

### Module 7: Practical Applications and Projects

**Key Concepts:**
- **Hands-On Projects:** Applying theoretical knowledge in practical projects solidifies understanding and reveals real-world challenges.
- **Collaboration:** Working in teams fosters collaborative learning, where diverse perspectives enhance problem-solving capabilities.

**Pseudo Code for a Simple ML Pipeline:**
```
function ml_pipeline(X_train, y_train, X_test):
    model = train_model_on_data(X_train, y_train)
    predictions = model_predict(model, X_test)
    return predictions
end function
```
