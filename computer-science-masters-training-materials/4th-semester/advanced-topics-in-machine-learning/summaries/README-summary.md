## Advanced Topics in Machine Learning

### Overview
This course provides an in-depth exploration of advanced topics in Machine Learning (ML), designed for learners with a solid understanding of basic ML concepts. It equips participants with the knowledge and skills necessary to tackle complex challenges in the field and apply cutting-edge methodologies across various domains.

### Module 1: Foundations of Advanced Machine Learning

**Background:**
- **Machine Learning Landscape:** Understanding foundational concepts such as supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning is crucial for exploring advanced topics.
- **Model Evaluation Metrics:** Knowing how to evaluate models is essential for assessing their effectiveness and guiding improvements.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Supervised Learning:** Learning from labeled data.
- **Unsupervised Learning:** Finding patterns in unlabeled data.
- **Reinforcement Learning:** Learning through interaction with an environment.

**Mathematical Notation:**
- **Loss Function (L):** Measures the difference between predicted values (\(y_{\text{pred}}\)) and actual values (\(y_{\text{true}}\)):
  \[
  L(y_{\text{true}}, y_{\text{pred}}) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_{\text{true}, i} - y_{\text{pred}, i})^2
  \]

**Pseudo Code for Model Evaluation:**
```python
def evaluate_model(y_true, y_pred):
    mse = mean_squared_error(y_true, y_pred)
    rmse = sqrt(mse)
    r_squared = 1 - (sum((y_true - y_pred) ** 2) / sum((y_true - mean(y_true)) ** 2))
    return rmse, r_squared
```

### Module 2: Deep Learning Architectures

**Background:**
- **Deep Learning (DL):** Characterized by networks with many layers. DL has gained prominence in fields like computer vision and natural language processing.
- **Neural Networks:** Composed of interconnected nodes (neurons) that process information.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):** Effective for image classification tasks.
- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs):** Designed for sequence data.
- **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs):** Consist of generator and discriminator networks.

**Mathematical Notation:**
- **CNN Convolution Operation:**
  \[
  (f * g)(x) = \sum_{a} f(a) g(x - a)
  \]
- **Activation Function (ReLU):**
  \[
  f(x) = \max(0, x)
  \]

**Pseudo Code for a Simple CNN:**
```python
def simple_cnn(input):
    conv_layer = conv2d(input, filters, kernel_size)
    activated_layer = relu(conv_layer)
    pooled_layer = max_pool(activated_layer, pool_size)

    output = dense(flattened_layer, num_classes)
    return output
```

### Module 3: Ensemble Learning Techniques

**Background:**
- **Ensemble Learning:** Combines predictions from multiple models for improved accuracy and robustness.
- **Bagging vs. Boosting:** Bagging reduces variance; boosting corrects errors from prior models.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Random Forests:** An ensemble of decision trees.
- **Gradient Boosting Machines (GBMs):** Sequentially builds trees to correct errors.

**Mathematical Notation:**
- **Random Forest Prediction:**
  \[
  \hat{y} = \frac{1}{T} \sum_{t=1}^{T} h_t(x)
  \]
  Where \(h_t\) is the prediction of the \(t\)-th tree.

**Pseudo Code for Random Forest:**
```python
def random_forest_predict(X, T):
    predictions = []
    for tree in T:
        predictions.append(tree.predict(X))
    return majority_vote(predictions)

### Module 4: Unsupervised Learning Techniques

**Background:**
- **Unsupervised Learning:** Crucial for discovering hidden structures in data.
- **Clustering and Dimensionality Reduction:** Techniques for grouping similar data points and reducing data complexity.

**Key Concepts:**
- **K-Means Clustering:**
  - **Objective:** Minimize the variance within each cluster.
- **Dimensionality Reduction (PCA):**
  - **Objective:** Maximize variance while minimizing dimensionality.

**Mathematical Notation:**
- **K-Means Objective Function:**
  \[
  J = \sum_{i=1}^{k} \sum_{x_j \in C_i} ||x_j - \mu_i||^2
  \]
  Where \(C_i\) is the \(i\)-th cluster and \(\mu_i\) is the centroid of that cluster.

**Pseudo Code for K-Means Clustering:**
```python
def k_means(X, k, max_iters):
    centroids = initialize_centroids(X, k)
    for _ in range(max_iters):
        labels = assign_labels(X, centroids)
        centroids = update_centroids(X, labels, k)
    return centroids, labels
```

### Module 5: Reinforcement Learning

**Background:**
- **Reinforcement Learning (RL):** Learns optimal actions through trial and error.
- **Exploration vs. Exploitation:** Balancing exploration of new actions and exploitation of known actions.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Markov Decision Processes (MDP):** A mathematical framework for modeling decision-making.
- **Q-Learning:** A value-based method for finding an optimal policy.

**Mathematical Notation:**
- **Q-Learning Update Rule:**
  \[
  Q(s, a) \leftarrow Q(s, a) + \alpha \left( r + \gamma \max_{a'} Q(s', a') - Q(s, a) \right)
  \]
  Where \( \alpha \) is the learning rate, \( r \) is the reward, and \( \gamma \) is the discount factor.

**Pseudo Code for Q-Learning:**
```python
def q_learning(env, num_episodes, alpha, gamma):
    Q = initialize_Q_table(env)
    for episode in range(num_episodes):
        state = env.reset()
        done = False
        while not done:
            action = choose_action(Q, state)
            next_state, reward, done = env.step(action)
            Q[state][action] += alpha * (reward + gamma * max(Q[next_state]) - Q[state][action])
            state = next_state
    return Q

  \[
  P(\hat{Y} = 1 | A = 1) = P(\hat{Y} = 1 | A = 0)
  \]
  Where \(A\) represents a protected attribute and \(\hat{Y}\) is the predicted outcome.

**Pseudo Code for Fairness Check:**
```python
def check_demographic_parity(y_true, y_pred, protected_attribute):
    parity = {}
    for value in set(protected_attribute):
        parity[value] = calculate_proportion(y_pred[protected_attribute == value])
