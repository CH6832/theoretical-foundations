### 93. **Unsupervised Anomaly Detection**
- **Task**: Implement unsupervised learning techniques for anomaly detection in a dataset and evaluate their effectiveness.
- **Code Example (Isolation Forest for Anomaly Detection)**:
```python
from sklearn.ensemble import IsolationForest
import numpy as np

# Sample data with anomalies
data = np.random.randn(100, 2)
data = np.vstack([data, [10, 10]])  # Adding an outlier

# Fit IsolationForest model
model = IsolationForest(contamination=0.1)
model.fit(data)

# Predict anomalies
predictions = model.predict(data)
print(f"Predictions: {predictions}")
```

### 94. **Interactive ML Systems**
- **Task**: Develop an interactive machine learning system that allows users to provide feedback and improve model performance.
- **Code Example (Interactive Feedback with Scikit-Learn)**:
```python
from sklearn.svm import SVC
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Load dataset
iris = load_iris()
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(iris.data, iris.target, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)

# Train

 an SVM model
model = SVC(probability=True)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Simulate user feedback on misclassified samples
for i, (sample, label) in enumerate(zip(X_test, y_test)):
    pred = model.predict([sample])
    if pred != label:
        print(f"Misclassified sample: {i}")
        # Simulated user correction
        corrected_label = label
        X_train = np.vstack([X_train, sample])
        y_train = np.append(y_train, corrected_label)
        model.fit(X_train, y_train)

print("Interactive learning completed.")
```
