### **Lattice-Based Cryptography**

**Overview:**
Lattice-based cryptography is built on mathematical problems related to lattice structures, which are grids of points in multidimensional space. These problems are believed to be hard for both classical and quantum computers, making them a strong candidate for post-quantum cryptography.

**Key Concepts:**
