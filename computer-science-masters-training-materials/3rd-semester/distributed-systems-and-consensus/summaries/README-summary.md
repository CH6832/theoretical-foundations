### 1. **Introduction to Distributed Systems**
A **distributed system** consists of multiple independent computers (nodes) that work together to appear as a single system to the user. These nodes communicate over a network, and each node can perform part of the overall computation. 

Key properties include:
- **Transparency**: The complexity of the underlying distribution is hidden from users.
- **Scalability**: The system can expand without major changes.
- **Fault tolerance**: It continues operating despite node failures.

**Pseudo code for a distributed email system:**

```pseudo
function send_email(email_data):
    server = find_nearest_server()
    server.store(email_data)
    broadcast_to_replicas(email_data)

function find_nearest_server():
    # Select the closest server based on user's location
    return nearest_server
```

### 2. **Communication in Distributed Systems**
Nodes in a distributed system communicate by **message passing** or **Remote Procedure Calls (RPC)**. Common communication protocols are **TCP/IP** for reliable transmission and **UDP** for faster, less reliable communication.

**Pseudo code for RPC communication:**

```pseudo
function rpc_call(server, request):
    response = send_message(server, request)
    return response

function send_message(server, request):
    if network_protocol == "TCP":
        establish_connection(server)
        send_data(request)
        return wait_for_response()
    elif network_protocol == "UDP":
        send_data_without_connection(request)
        return None
```

### 3. **Consistency and Replication**
In a distributed system, **replication** ensures copies of data exist in multiple nodes for fault tolerance. **Consistency** ensures all nodes agree on the data values.

- **Strong consistency**: All nodes see the same data at the same time.
- **Eventual consistency**: Nodes eventually converge to the same data.

**Pseudo code for data replication:**

```pseudo
function replicate_data(data):
    for server in replica_servers:
        send_data(server, data)

function update_data(new_data):
    replicate_data(new_data)
    update_local_copy(new_data)
```

### 4. **Consensus Algorithms**
**Consensus algorithms** ensure all nodes in a distributed system agree on a single value or state, even in the presence of faults.

- **Paxos** and **Raft** are common algorithms for achieving consensus.
- **Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT)** handles malicious nodes.

**Pseudo code for Raft consensus:**

```pseudo
function leader_election():
    candidate = start_election()
    vote_count = gather_votes()
    if vote_count > majority:
        become_leader()

function gather_votes():
    votes = 0
    for node in nodes:
        if node.supports(candidate):
            votes += 1
    return votes
```

### 5. **Fault Tolerance and Recovery**
**Fault tolerance** ensures the system remains operational even when some components fail. **Recovery mechanisms** like checkpoints or log-based recovery restore the system to a consistent state after a failure.

**Pseudo code for checkpointing:**

```pseudo
function save_checkpoint(state):
    backup_server.store(state)
    
function recover_from_failure():
    state = backup_server.retrieve_latest_checkpoint()
    restore_state(state)
```

### 6. **Scalability and Performance**
A **scalable system** can handle increasing load by adding more resources. Performance is measured through metrics like **latency** and **throughput**.

- **Sharding** divides data into smaller partitions.
- **Load balancing** distributes tasks across multiple servers.

**Pseudo code for load balancing:**

```pseudo
function distribute_requests(request):
    server = get_least_busy_server()
    server.handle_request(request)

function get_least_busy_server():
    return server_with_min_load()
```

### 7. **Security in Distributed Systems**
Security is essential to protect distributed systems from attacks such as **Denial of Service (DoS)** and **Sybil attacks**. Techniques include **encryption**, **authentication**, and secure communication protocols like **SSL/TLS**.

**Pseudo code for secure communication:**

```pseudo
function secure_send(message, recipient):
    encrypted_message = encrypt(message, recipient.public_key)
    send(encrypted_message)

function authenticate_user(user_credentials):
    if verify_credentials(user_credentials):
        grant_access(user)
    else:
        deny_access(user)
```

### 8. **Case Studies and Applications**
**Distributed systems** have real-world applications in cloud computing, distributed databases, and file systems like **Google Spanner** and **Amazon DynamoDB**.

**Pseudo code for distributed file access (e.g., Dropbox):**

```pseudo
function upload_file(file):
    chunked_file = divide_into_chunks(file)
    for chunk in chunked_file:
        store_in_server(chunk)
    replicate_across_servers(chunked_file)
```

### 9. **Emerging Topics**
Emerging technologies like **Blockchain**, **Edge Computing**, and **Quantum Computing** are reshaping distributed systems.

- **Blockchain** ensures decentralization through consensus algorithms.
- **Edge computing** reduces latency by processing data closer to its source.

**Pseudo code for blockchain transaction verification:**

```pseudo
function verify_transaction(transaction):
    if consensus_reached(transaction):
        add_to_blockchain(transaction)

function consensus_reached(transaction):
    for node in network:
        if node.validates(transaction):
            return True
    return False
```

### 10. **Project and Practical Work**
A **distributed chat application** could be a capstone project. Messages are sent and replicated across multiple servers for high availability.

**Pseudo code for message replication in a chat app:**

```pseudo
function send_message(user, message):
    nearest_server.store_message(user, message)
    replicate_message_to_other_servers(user, message)

function replicate_message_to_other_servers(user, message):
    for server in backup_servers:
        send_message_to_server(server, user, message)
```

### 11. **Ethics and Future Trends**
As distributed systems become more pervasive, ethical concerns about **privacy** and **data security** grow. Future trends include **advancements in blockchain**, **edge computing**, and **quantum computing**.

**Pseudo code for privacy-preserving data access:**

```pseudo
function access_data(user, request):
    if user_has_permission(user, request):
        return encrypt_and_send_data(request)
    else:
        deny_request(user)
```
