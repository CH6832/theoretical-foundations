## **Course 2: Algorithmic Game Theory and Mechanism Design**

### **README.md - Learning Overview**

This course provides an in-depth exploration of the intersection of economics and theoretical computer science, focusing on the use of game theory to analyze algorithms and design incentive-compatible mechanisms. The course covers a variety of topics, including Nash equilibria, auction theory, mechanism design, price of anarchy, and applications to modern fields like e-commerce and blockchain technology. These topics help students understand how strategic interactions between rational agents can be modeled, analyzed, and optimized using algorithmic techniques.

#### **Key Topics:**

1. **Nash Equilibria and Dominant Strategies**
   - **Nash Equilibria:**
     - **Concept:** Nash equilibrium represents a stable state in a game where no player can benefit by unilaterally changing their strategy, given the strategies of the other players.
     - **Analysis:** Explore how Nash equilibria are computed in various games (e.g., matrix games, extensive form games) using methods like best response dynamics.
     - **Significance:** Understand the role of Nash equilibria in modeling competitive environments, from auctions to multi-agent systems.

     **Example Pseudo Code:**
     ```pseudo
     function find_nash_equilibrium(game):
         for each player in game:
             initialize strategy for player
         while strategies not converged:
             for each player in game:
                 best_response = calculate_best_response(player, other_players_strategies)
                 update player strategy to best_response
         return strategies
     ```

   - **Dominant Strategies:**
     - **Concept:** A dominant strategy is one that results in the best outcome for a player, regardless of the strategies chosen by other players.
     - **Application:** Learn how dominant strategies simplify game analysis and ensure stable outcomes in specific contexts (e.g., auctions).
     - **Difference from Nash Equilibrium:** A dominant strategy equilibrium always guarantees a Nash equilibrium, but not all Nash equilibria arise from dominant strategies.

     **Example Pseudo Code:**
     ```pseudo
     function find_dominant_strategy(game):
         for each player in game:
             for each strategy of player:
                 if strategy dominates all other strategies:
                     set strategy as dominant
         return dominant strategies if exist, else "no dominant strategy"
     ```

2. **Mechanism Design**
   - **Vickrey Auctions:**
     - **Principle:** Vickrey auctions, also known as second-price auctions, incentivize bidders to bid their true value since the highest bidder wins but pays the second-highest bid.
     - **Strategic Implication:** Understand how truthful bidding emerges as a dominant strategy and ensures efficient allocation.

     **Example Pseudo Code for Second-Price Auction:**
     ```pseudo
     function vickrey_auction(bids):
         highest_bid = max(bids)
         second_highest_bid = second_max(bids)
         winner = player_with_highest_bid
         return winner, second_highest_bid
     ```

   - **Gibbard-Satterthwaite Theorem:**
     - **Concept:** This theorem shows that in any voting system with at least three candidates, it’s impossible to design a system that always results in a truthful revelation of preferences without encountering strategic manipulation.
     - **Implications:** Learn how this result guides the design of voting mechanisms and their limitations.

3. **Price of Anarchy and Efficiency of Equilibria**
   - **Price of Anarchy (PoA):**
     - **Concept:** PoA quantifies the efficiency loss in a system due to selfish behavior by comparing the worst Nash equilibrium to the optimal social outcome.
     - **Analysis:** Understand how PoA is computed in various systems, such as traffic networks, and its impact on algorithmic design for decentralized systems.

     **Example Pseudo Code:**
     ```pseudo
     function calculate_price_of_anarchy(game, social_optimum):
         worst_nash = find_worst_nash_equilibrium(game)
         poa = worst_nash / social_optimum
         return poa
     ```

4. **Algorithmic Mechanism Design in Online Markets**
   - **Algorithmic Mechanism Design:**
     - **Concept:** Algorithmic mechanism design involves designing algorithms that account for strategic behavior, particularly in online settings like e-commerce.
     - **Application:** Learn how to apply mechanism design in real-world online auctions, ad markets, and matching platforms.

     **Example Pseudo Code for Online Auction Mechanism:**
     ```pseudo
     function online_auction(bids, time_interval):
         for each time_interval:
             collect new bids
             run auction algorithm to allocate items based on current bids
         return allocation and prices
     ```

   - **E-commerce:** Understand how online platforms leverage game-theoretic principles to create efficient, incentive-compatible markets.
   - **Cryptoeconomics:** Study how blockchain systems utilize game theory to incentivize behaviors such as mining and consensus in decentralized networks.

6. **Game-Theoretic Analysis of Blockchain Incentives**
   - **Incentive Mechanisms in Blockchain:**
     - **Concept:** Blockchain protocols are designed to incentivize participants (miners, validators) to act in the network's best interest, using rewards and penalties.
     - **Analysis:** Learn how various incentive mechanisms, such as proof-of-work or proof-of-stake, are analyzed using game theory.

     **Example Pseudo Code for Proof-of-Work:**
     ```pseudo
     function proof_of_work(incentive_mechanism, difficulty):
         while not valid_block:
             miner = choose_miner_based_on_incentive(incentive_mechanism)
             new_block = miner.solve_puzzle(difficulty)
             if new_block is valid:
                 add_block_to_chain(new_block)
                 reward_miner(miner)
         return updated_blockchain
