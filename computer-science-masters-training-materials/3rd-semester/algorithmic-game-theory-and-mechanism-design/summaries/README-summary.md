## **Course 2: Algorithmic Game Theory and Mechanism Design**

### **README.md - Learning Overview**

This course integrates principles from economics and theoretical computer science to examine algorithms through the framework of game theory and incentive structures. Students will explore the design of mechanisms and auctions and analyze their efficiency and strategic properties. Key areas of focus include Nash equilibria, auction theory, price of anarchy, and applications in e-commerce and blockchain technology.
