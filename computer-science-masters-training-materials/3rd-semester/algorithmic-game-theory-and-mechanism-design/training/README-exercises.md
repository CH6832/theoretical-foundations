Here are detailed explanations and implementations for each of the exercises related to Nash equilibria and mechanism design.

### **1. Nash Equilibria and Dominant Strategies**

---

#### **Exercise 1: Nash Equilibrium in the Prisoner's Dilemma**

**Analysis**:
- The classic prisoner's dilemma payoff matrix is as follows:

|              | Player B Cooperates | Player B Defects |
|--------------|---------------------|------------------|
| Player A Cooperates | (3, 3)               | (0, 5)            |
| Player A Defects    | (5, 0)               | (1, 1)            |

- **Equilibrium Strategies**: Both players defect (Defect, Defect).
- **Payoffs**: Each player receives a payoff of 1.

**Implementation**:
```python
def prisoners_dilemma():
    payoff_matrix = {
        ('C', 'C'): (3, 3),
        ('C', 'D'): (0, 5),
        ('D', 'C'): (5, 0),
        ('D', 'D'): (1, 1)
    }

    strategies = ['C', 'D']
    equilibrium = ('D', 'D')
    payoffs = payoff_matrix[equilibrium]

    return equilibrium, payoffs

# Example usage
equilibrium, payoffs = prisoners_dilemma()
print(f"Nash Equilibrium: {equilibrium}, Payoffs: {payoffs}")
```

---

#### **Exercise 2: Coordination Game Payoff Matrix**

**Payoff Matrix**:
- Firms can choose either High (H) or Low (L) prices.

|              | Firm B: H   | Firm B: L   |
|--------------|-------------|-------------|
| Firm A: H    | (2, 2)     | (0, 3)     |
| Firm A: L    | (3, 0)     | (1, 1)     |

**Nash Equilibria**: 
- (H, H) and (L, L) are Nash equilibria.

**Implementation**:
```python
def coordination_game():
    payoff_matrix = {
        ('H', 'H'): (2, 2),
        ('H', 'L'): (0, 3),
        ('L', 'H'): (3, 0),
        ('L', 'L'): (1, 1)
    }

    nash_equilibria = [('H', 'H'), ('L', 'L')]
    return nash_equilibria, payoff_matrix

| A: S2       | (3, 0, 3) | (1, 1, 1) |

**Nash Equilibria**:
- Equilibria can be found by checking best responses. In this case, (S1, S1, S1) is one equilibrium.

**Implementation**:
```python
def three_player_game():
    payoff_matrix = {
        ('S1', 'S1', 'S1'): (2, 2, 2),
        ('S1', 'S1', 'S2'): (0, 3, 1),
        ('S1', 'S2', 'S1'): (3, 0, 3),
        ('S2', 'S1', 'S1'): (1, 1, 1)
    }

    nash_equilibria = [('S1', 'S1', 'S1')]
    return nash_equilibria, payoff_matrix

# Example usage
equilibria, payoffs = three_player_game()
print(f"Nash Equilibrium: {equilibria}, Payoff Matrix: {payoffs}")
```

**Implementation**:
```python
def cooperation_defection_game():
    payoff_matrix = {
        ('C', 'C'): (3, 3),
        ('C', 'D'): (0, 5),
        ('D', 'C'): (5, 0),
        ('D', 'D'): (1, 1)
    }

    dominant_strategies = ('D', 'D')
    return dominant_strategies, payoff_matrix

# Example usage

| Player A: Y  | (2, 0)       | (1, 1)       |

**Mixed Strategy Equilibrium Calculation**:
- Assume Player A plays X with probability \(p\) and Y with \(1-p\), while Player B plays X with \(q\) and Y with \(1-q\). Solve for \(p\) and \(q\).

**Implementation**:
```python

    E_B = q * (1 * p + 2 * (1 - p)) + (1 - q) * (0 * p + 1 * (1 - p))

    # Set expected payoffs equal for mixed strategies
    eq1 = Eq(E_A.diff(p), 0)
    eq2 = Eq(E_B.diff(q), 0)

    solution = solve((eq1, eq2), (p, q))
    return solution

Here’s a detailed exploration of the exercises related to applications in e-commerce and cryptoeconomics, focusing on designing mechanisms and analyzing strategies.

### **5. Applications to E-commerce and Cryptoeconomics**

---

#### **Exercise 41: Dynamic Pricing Algorithm for Online Auctions**

**Concept**:
Dynamic pricing can be employed to adjust prices in real-time based on demand, bidding behavior, and time remaining in the auction.

**Implementation**:
```python
class DynamicPricingAuction:
    def __init__(self, base_price, increment):
        self.current_price = base_price
        self.increment = increment
        self.bids = []

    def place_bid(self, bid):
        if bid >= self.current_price:
            self.bids.append(bid)
            self.current_price += self.increment  # Increase price after each valid bid
            return True
        return False

    def get_highest_bid(self):
        if self.bids:
            return max(self.bids)
        return None

# Example usage
auction = DynamicPricingAuction(base_price=100, increment=10)
auction.place_bid(100)
auction.place_bid(110)
highest_bid = auction.get_highest_bid()
print(f"Current Highest Bid: {highest_bid}, Current Price: {auction.current_price}")
```

**Analysis**:
- **Bidders' Strategies**: Bidders may wait to see how many others are bidding before placing higher bids, which can lead to a late bidding frenzy.
- **Auction Outcomes**: The auction may close at a higher price due to increased competition, but it may discourage early bidders who are not willing to overbid.

---

#### **Exercise 42: Game Theory in Digital Advertising Auctions**

**Concept**:
Digital advertising relies heavily on auctions to determine ad placements. Advertisers must strategize based on competitors' bids.

**Implementation**:
```python
def analyze_advertising_auction(advertisers_bids):
    total_bids = sum(advertisers_bids)
    winning_bid = max(advertisers_bids)
    winning_advertiser = advertisers_bids.index(winning_bid)
    return winning_bid, winning_advertiser, total_bids

# Example usage
advertisers_bids = [150, 200, 300]
winning_bid, winner, total = analyze_advertising_auction(advertisers_bids)
print(f"Winning Bid: {winning_bid}, Winner: Advertiser {winner}, Total Bids: {total}")
```

**Impact on Auction Outcomes**:
- Higher bids from competitors can encourage advertisers to increase their bids, leading to a bidding war.
- Advertisers must consider not only their budget but also the expected responses of their competitors.

#### **Exercise 43: Blockchain in E-commerce Transactions**

**Concept**:
Using blockchain for secure and efficient transactions can reduce fraud and improve trust.

**Smart Contract Mechanism**:
```python
class SmartContract:
    def __init__(self):
        self.balances = {}

    def deposit(self, user, amount):
        if user not in self.balances:
            self.balances[user] = 0
        self.balances[user] += amount

    def transfer(self, from_user, to_user, amount):
        if self.balances.get(from_user, 0) >= amount:
            self.balances[from_user] -= amount
            if to_user not in self.balances:
                self.balances[to_user] = 0
            self.balances[to_user] += amount
            return True
        return False

# Example usage
contract = SmartContract()
contract.deposit("Alice", 100)
contract.transfer("Alice", "Bob", 50)
print(contract.balances)
```

**Analysis**:
- This mechanism ensures that transactions are transparent and irreversible, reducing the chances of fraud.
- Smart contracts can enforce terms automatically, increasing efficiency.

#### **Exercise 44: Cryptoeconomics in DeFi Protocols**

**Concept**:
Incentive mechanisms in DeFi protocols can promote user participation while ensuring the security of the protocol.

**Analysis**:
- **Staking**: Users stake tokens to participate in governance or earn rewards. The more tokens they stake, the greater their influence and potential rewards.
- **Liquidity Mining**: Users are rewarded for providing liquidity, thus ensuring that the protocol has enough liquidity for trades.

**Mechanism Design**:
```python
class DeFiProtocol:
    def __init__(self):
        self.stakes = {}

    def stake_tokens(self, user, amount):
        if user not in self.stakes:
            self.stakes[user] = 0
        self.stakes[user] += amount

    def get_total_stake(self):
        return sum(self.stakes.values())

# Example usage
defi_protocol = DeFiProtocol()
defi_protocol.stake_tokens("User1", 100)
defi_protocol.stake_tokens("User2", 200)
total_stake = defi_protocol.get_total_stake()
print(f"Total Stake in DeFi Protocol: {total_stake}")
```

#### **Exercise 45: Marketplace for Digital Goods Using Blockchain**

**Design**:
Create a decentralized marketplace that ensures fairness and transparency using blockchain.

**Implementation**:
```python
class DigitalMarketplace:
    def __init__(self):
        self.items = []

    def list_item(self, item_name, price):
        self.items.append({"name": item_name, "price": price, "sold": False})

    def purchase_item(self, buyer, item_index):
        if not self.items[item_index]['sold']:
            self.items[item_index]['sold'] = True
            return f"{buyer} purchased {self.items[item_index]['name']} for {self.items[item_index]['price']}."
        return "Item already sold."

# Example usage
marketplace = DigitalMarketplace()
marketplace.list_item("E-book", 10)
purchase_message = marketplace.purchase_item("Alice", 0)
print(purchase_message)
```

**Effectiveness**:
- Using blockchain for item verification prevents counterfeit goods and assures buyers of item authenticity.
- Transparent transaction records build trust among users.

---

#### **Exercise 46: Transaction Fees in Blockchain-Based E-commerce**

**Concept**:
Balancing transaction fees is essential for maintaining efficiency while ensuring that the platform is sustainable.

**Implementation**:
```python
def transaction_fee_analysis(total_transactions, fee_per_transaction):
    total_fees = total_transactions * fee_per_transaction
    return total_fees

# Example usage
total_transactions = 500
fee_per_transaction = 0.01  # in cryptocurrency
total_fees = transaction_fee_analysis(total_transactions, fee_per_transaction)
print(f"Total Transaction Fees: {total_fees}")
```

**Mechanism Design**:
- Introduce dynamic fees based on network congestion to maintain transaction efficiency while covering costs.

---

#### **Exercise 47: Mechanism Design in Supply Chains for E-commerce**

**Concept**:
Optimize supply chains by structuring incentives for different players (suppliers, distributors, retailers).

**Implementation**:
```python
class SupplyChain:
    def __init__(self):
        self.participants = {}

    def add_participant(self, name, role):
        self.participants[name] = {"role": role, "performance": 0}

    def incentivize_performance(self, name, reward):
        if name in self.participants:
            self.participants[name]["performance"] += reward

# Example usage
supply_chain = SupplyChain()
supply_chain.add_participant("Supplier1", "Supplier")
supply_chain.incentivize_performance("Supplier1", 500)
print(supply_chain.participants)
```

**Analysis**:
- Properly structured incentives can improve cooperation between supply chain participants, leading to increased efficiency and reduced costs.

#### **Exercise 48: Mechanism for Decentralized Voting**

**Concept**:
Design a decentralized voting system using blockchain for security and transparency.

**Implementation**:
```python
class DecentralizedVoting:
    def __init__(self):
        self.votes = {}

    def cast_vote(self, voter_id, candidate):
        if voter_id not in self.votes:
            self.votes[voter_id] = candidate
            return True
        return False

    def tally_votes(self):
        tally = {}
        for candidate in self.votes.values():
            tally[candidate] = tally.get(candidate, 0) + 1
        return tally

# Example usage
voting_system = DecentralizedVoting()
voting_system.cast_vote("Voter1", "Candidate A")
voting_system.cast_vote("Voter2", "Candidate B")
results = voting_system.tally_votes()
print(f"Voting Results: {results}")
```

**Effectiveness**:
- The use of blockchain ensures that each vote is securely recorded and tamper-proof, promoting trust in the electoral process.

---

#### **Exercise 49: Game Theory in Cryptocurrency Mining**

**Concept**:
Analyze how miners are incentivized to secure the network.

**Analysis**:
- Miners compete to solve cryptographic puzzles, receiving block rewards and transaction fees.
- This competition ensures that the network remains secure and decentralized.

**Incentive Structure**:
```python
class MiningPool:
    def __init__(self):
        self.total_hashrate = 0
        self.miners = {}

    def join_pool(self, miner_id, hashrate):
        self.miners[miner_id] = hashrate
        self.total_hashrate += hashrate

    def calculate_rewards(self, block_reward):
        rewards = {miner: (hastrate / self.total_hashrate) * block_reward for miner, hastrate in self.miners.items()}
        return rewards

# Example usage
mining_pool = MiningPool()
mining_pool.join_pool("Miner1", 100)
mining_pool.join_pool("Miner2", 200)
rewards = mining

_pool.calculate_rewards(block_reward=50)
print(f"Miner Rewards: {rewards}")
```

**Impact**:
- A higher hashrate means a better chance of earning rewards, encouraging more miners to join and thus securing the network.

---

#### **Exercise 50: Algorithmic Game Theory in dApps Design**

**Concept**:
Evaluate how game theory can be used to design decentralized applications that promote user engagement.

**Analysis**:
- User incentives must align with the goals of the dApp (e.g., token rewards for participation).
- Mechanisms like staking or governance can ensure that users contribute to the ecosystem positively.

**Implementation**:
```python
class DApp:
    def __init__(self):
        self.users = {}

    def register_user(self, user_id):
        self.users[user_id] = {"stake": 0, "engagement": 0}

    def stake_tokens(self, user_id, amount):
        if user_id in self.users:
            self.users[user_id]["stake"] += amount
            self.users[user_id]["engagement"] += 1

# Example usage
dapp = DApp()
dapp.register_user("User1")
dapp.stake_tokens("User1", 50)
print(dapp.users)
```

**Mechanism Evaluation**:
- Engagement can be incentivized through rewards or governance rights, enhancing user retention and participation.
