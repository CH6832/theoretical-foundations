### Exercises for PAC Learning Model and VC Dimension

1. **PAC Learning Proof**: 
   - **Proof**: Show that if a hypothesis class \( H \) is finite, it is PAC-learnable. The sample complexity \( m \) to ensure that the learning algorithm can achieve error \( \epsilon \) with confidence \( 1 - \delta \) is given by:
     \[
     m \geq \frac{1}{\epsilon} \left( \log |H| + \log \frac{1}{\delta} \right)
     \]
   - **Discussion**: Sample complexity grows logarithmically with \( |H| \) and inversely with \( \epsilon \) and \( \delta \).

2. **VC Dimension Calculation**: 
   - **Calculation**: The VC dimension of linear classifiers in 2D is 3. You can show that any three points can be shattered if they are not collinear.
   - **Example**: For points \((0,0)\), \((1,0)\), and \((0,1)\), all possible labelings can be achieved by appropriate lines.

3. **Generalization Error Bound**: 
   - **Derivation**: For a hypothesis class \( H \) with VC dimension \( d \):
     \[
     \text{Generalization Error} \leq \hat{E}(h) + \sqrt{\frac{d \log(2m/d) + \log(1/\delta)}{m}}
     \]
   - Where \( \hat{E}(h) \) is the empirical error.

4. **PAC Learnability Example**: 
   - **Demonstration**: Show that \( k \)-nearest neighbors is PAC-learnable. Given enough labeled data, it can approximate any function well if the training set is large enough.

5. **VC Dimension of Polynomial Models**:
