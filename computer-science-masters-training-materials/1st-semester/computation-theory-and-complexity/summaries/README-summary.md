### **README.md - Learning Overview**

**Computation Theory and Complexity** is a deep dive into the mathematical boundaries of computation. It covers the basics of Turing machines and moves into the classification of problems based on computational complexity, discussing how resource constraints (time, space, randomness) affect the solvability of problems. The course also includes a modern perspective, discussing quantum computation and its potential impact on classical complexity. 

At the heart of the course is the P vs NP problem, one of the most famous open problems in computer science, and an introduction to quantum complexity through classes like BQP and QMA.
