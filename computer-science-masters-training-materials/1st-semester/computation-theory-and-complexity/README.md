#### **Course 2: Computation Theory and Complexity**

This course explores the mathematical limits of computation, covering complexity classes, resource-bounded computation, and the frontier of open problems like P vs NP. A modern twist includes quantum complexity and its relationship to classical complexity classes.

**Key Topics:**
- Turing Machines, Computability, and Complexity Classes (P, NP, PSPACE, EXP)
- Reductions and NP-Completeness
- Randomized Complexity Classes (RP, BPP, etc.)
- Quantum Complexity (BQP, QMA)
- P vs NP and Modern Conjectures
- Circuits and Boolean Function Complexity
