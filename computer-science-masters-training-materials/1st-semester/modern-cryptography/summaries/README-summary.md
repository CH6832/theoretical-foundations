## Course 4: Modern Cryptography

### README.md - Learning Overview

This course explores the theoretical foundations and practical applications of modern cryptographic techniques. Emphasis is placed on understanding the principles and algorithms behind encryption, digital signatures, and protocol design. Key areas of focus include:

- **Symmetric Encryption**: Techniques such as AES, which ensure data confidentiality through a shared secret key.
- **Asymmetric Encryption**: Methods like RSA that utilize public and private key pairs for secure communication.
- **Digital Signatures**: Mechanisms to verify the authenticity and integrity of messages.
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Protocols enabling one party to prove knowledge of a secret without revealing the secret itself.
- **Homomorphic Encryption**: Techniques allowing computations on encrypted data without decryption.
- **Lattice-Based Cryptography**: Cryptographic methods based on the hardness of lattice problems, important for post-quantum security.
- **Quantum-Resistant Cryptography**: Algorithms designed to be secure against the potential future capabilities of quantum computers.
- **Privacy-Preserving Techniques**: Methods such as Differential Privacy that protect individual data while allowing for aggregate analysis.
