**Objective**: Simulate a portfolio of 10 different stocks over 1 year using Monte Carlo methods and estimate Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR).

1. **Modeling Stock Returns**:
   - Assume each stock returns follow a normal distribution defined by a mean return \(\mu_i\) and standard deviation \(\sigma_i\).
   - For example, let’s say:
     - Stock 1: \(\mu_1 = 0.08\), \(\sigma_1 = 0.15\)
     - Stock 2: \(\mu_2 = 0.05\), \(\sigma_2 = 0.10\)
     - And so on for 10 stocks.

2. **Simulating Returns**:
   - Generate random returns for each stock using the numpy library in Python.

     \text{VaR} = -\text{quantile}(\text{returns}, 0.05)
     \]
   - **CVaR**: Calculate the expected loss exceeding the VaR threshold.
