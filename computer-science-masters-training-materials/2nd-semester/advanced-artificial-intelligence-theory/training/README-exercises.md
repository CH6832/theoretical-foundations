### 1. **Complexity Theory in AI (P vs NP in AI Problems)**

### 1. **NP-Complete Problem Classification**

#### **Problem Classification:**
- **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)**: NP-complete in general. Given a set of cities and distances, find the shortest route that visits each city once and returns to the start.
  - **Exact Algorithm**: Dynamic Programming (Held-Karp) runs in \(O(n^2 2^n)\).
  - **Approximation Algorithm**: Christofides' Algorithm (for metric TSP) provides a 3/2-approximation.

- **Knapsack Problem**: NP-complete for the 0/1 variant. Given a set of items with weights and values, select items to maximize value without exceeding a weight limit.
  - **Exact Algorithm**: Dynamic Programming solution runs in \(O(nW)\), where \(n\) is the number of items and \(W\) is the maximum capacity.
  - **Approximation Algorithm**: Greedy approximation or PTAS achieves near-optimal solutions.

#### **Implementation & Comparison:**

- **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)**:
  ```python
  def tsp_exact(graph):
      # Dynamic Programming implementation
      pass

  def tsp_approx(graph):
      # Christofides Algorithm approximation
      pass
  ```

- **Knapsack Problem**:
  ```python
  def knapsack_exact(values, weights, capacity):
      # DP-based exact knapsack solution
      pass

  def knapsack_approx(values, weights, capacity):
      # PTAS or greedy-based approximation
      pass
  ```

- **Comparison**: For both TSP and Knapsack, exact solutions are only feasible for small instances. Approximate algorithms offer significant speed improvements with acceptable solution quality.

---

### 2. **Reduction Demonstration:**

#### **Problem**: Show that **Subset Sum** is NP-complete by reducing from **Knapsack**.

#### **Proof**:
- **Knapsack Problem**: Given items with weights and values, the goal is to maximize the value without exceeding a weight limit.
- **Subset Sum Problem**: Given a set of integers, determine if there is a subset whose sum equals a given target.

#### **Reduction**: Transform an instance of the Knapsack Problem into an instance of Subset Sum. For each item in the knapsack problem, set its weight equal to its value. The goal is to check if a subset of items can achieve a weight sum exactly equal to the capacity.

- **Formal Proof**:
  1. Construct a Subset Sum instance where each number corresponds to an item's weight.
  2. The target sum is the knapsack's weight limit.
  3. Any solution to the Subset Sum problem maps to a valid solution to the Knapsack problem.

#### **Implications for Algorithm Design**: Since Subset Sum is NP-complete, efficient algorithms for the problem are unlikely, and approximate or heuristic methods are preferred for large instances.

---

### 3. **Heuristic Design for NP-Hard Problems**

#### **Problem**: Design a heuristic for **Bin Packing Problem**.

#### **Heuristic**: First-Fit Decreasing (FFD).
- **Algorithm**:
  1. Sort the items in decreasing order of size.
  2. Place each item in the first bin that has enough remaining space.
  3. If no bin can accommodate the item, create a new bin.

#### **Implementation**:
```python
def first_fit_decreasing(items, bin_capacity):
    bins = []
    items.sort(reverse=True)
    for item in items:
        placed = False
        for b in bins:
            if sum(b) + item <= bin_capacity:
                b.append(item)
                placed = True
                break
        if not placed:
            bins.append([item])
    return bins
```

#### **Evaluation**:
- Test the heuristic on various benchmark datasets.
- Compare the number of bins used with the optimal solution.
- Analyze performance in terms of time complexity \(O(n \log n)\), due to sorting the items.

---

### 4. **Polynomial-Time Approximation Scheme (PTAS)**

#### **Problem**: Implement PTAS for the **Knapsack Problem**.

#### **Algorithm**:
1. Scale down the item values based on an approximation factor \( \epsilon \).
2. Use a dynamic programming approach on the scaled-down values.
3. Return the solution with an approximation ratio of \(1 - \epsilon\).

#### **Implementation**:
```python
def knapsack_ptas(values, weights, capacity, epsilon):
    n = len(values)
    scale_factor = epsilon * max(values) / n
    scaled_values = [v // scale_factor for v in values]
    
    # DP solution with scaled values
    dp = [0] * (capacity + 1)
    for i in range(n):
        for w in range(capacity, weights[i] - 1, -1):
            dp[w] = max(dp[w], dp[w - weights[i]] + scaled_values[i])
    return dp[capacity] * scale_factor
```

#### **Analysis**:
- **Approximation Ratio**: \(1 - \epsilon\), where \(\epsilon\) is a small constant chosen by the user.
- **Computational Efficiency**: Similar to the DP solution with a reduced input size, making it feasible for larger instances compared to the exact DP algorithm.

---

### 5. **Complexity Analysis of Machine Learning Algorithms**

#### **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**:
- **Time Complexity**:
  - Training SVM with a linear kernel: \(O(n^2)\), where \(n\) is the number of training samples.
  - With non-linear kernels (e.g., RBF): \(O(n^3)\) due to kernel evaluations.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(n^2)\), mainly due to the kernel matrix storage.
- **Scalability**: SVMs struggle with large datasets because of high time and space complexity, especially with non-linear kernels.

#### **k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)**:
- **Time Complexity**:
  - Training: \(O(1)\), since k-NN requires no explicit training.
  - Inference: \(O(n \cdot d)\), where \(n\) is the number of training samples and \(d\) is the dimensionality.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(nd)\) to store the training data.
- **Scalability**: k-NN is highly inefficient for large datasets, as every prediction requires a linear scan of all training points. KD-trees or approximate nearest neighbors can be used to reduce complexity.

#### **General Discussion**:
- **Effect on Scalability**: Algorithms like SVM and k-NN face issues with large datasets, especially in high-dimensional spaces. Reducing the dimensionality or employing approximate methods (e.g., random projections) can improve scalability.

### 2. **Probabilistic Reasoning and Graphical Models**

#### **Problem**: Construct a Bayesian network for **medical diagnosis** to predict the likelihood of a disease based on observed symptoms.

#### **Steps**:
1. **Nodes** represent random variables (e.g., Disease, Fever, Cough, Fatigue).
2. **Edges** represent conditional dependencies (e.g., Disease → Fever, Disease → Cough).
3. **Conditional Probability Tables (CPTs)** represent the probability of each node given its parents.

#### **Example Network**:
- **Nodes**:
  - Disease (Yes/No)
  - Fever (Yes/No)
  - Cough (Yes/No)
  - Fatigue (Yes/No)

- **CPT for Disease**:
  \[
  P(\text{Disease}) = [0.01, 0.99] \quad \text{(probability of having the disease is 1%)}
  \]

- **CPT for Fever**:
  \[
  P(\text{Fever}|\text{Disease}) = 
  \begin{bmatrix}
  P(\text{Yes}|\text{Yes}) = 0.8 \\
  P(\text{Yes}|\text{No}) = 0.2
  \end{bmatrix}
  \]

#### **Inference**: 
Given observed evidence, such as Fever = Yes and Cough = Yes, compute the probability that the patient has the disease using **Bayesian inference**.

#### **Implementation** (using Python libraries like `pgmpy`):
```python
from pgmpy.models import BayesianNetwork
from pgmpy.factors.discrete import TabularCPD
from pgmpy.inference import VariableElimination

# Define the network structure
model = BayesianNetwork([('Disease', 'Fever'), ('Disease', 'Cough')])

# Define the CPDs
cpd_disease = TabularCPD(variable='Disease', variable_card=2, values=[[0.01], [0.99]])
cpd_fever = TabularCPD(variable='Fever', variable_card=2,
                       values=[[0.8, 0.2], [0.2, 0.8]], evidence=['Disease'], evidence_card=[2])
cpd_cough = TabularCPD(variable='Cough', variable_card=2,
                       values=[[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]], evidence=['Disease'], evidence_card=[2])

# Add CPDs to the model
model.add_cpds(cpd_disease, cpd_fever, cpd_cough)

# Inference
inference = VariableElimination(model)
result = inference.query(variables=['Disease'], evidence={'Fever': 1, 'Cough': 1})
print(result)
```

#### **Result**: The network can predict the likelihood of a disease based on observed symptoms like fever and cough, useful in medical diagnosis scenarios.

import numpy as np

# Train HMM on a tagged corpus
train_data = nltk.corpus.brown.tagged_sents(categories='news')
words = set(word for sent in train_data for word, tag in sent)
tags = set(tag for sent in train_data for word, tag in sent)

# Create the HMM model (for simplicity, assume known transition/emission probabilities)
model = hmm.MultinomialHMM(n_components=len(tags))
# Training step: Define the emission and transition matrices using training data (details omitted)

# Test on a new sentence
test_sentence = ['The', 'dog', 'barked']
# Convert test sentence to observations, run Viterbi to predict tags
# Compare predicted tags with the true tags to compute precision, recall, and F1-score
```

#### **Performance Evaluation**:
- **Precision**: \( \frac{\text{True Positives}}{\text{True Positives} + \text{False Positives}} \)
- **Recall**: \( \frac{\text{True Positives}}{\text{True Positives} + \text{False Negatives}} \)
- **F1-Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall.
