### 1. Introduction, Linear Classification, Perceptron Update Rule

The content is based on [Machine Learning 6.867 MIT OpenCourseWare](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-867-machine-learning-fall-2006/).

**Concepts**: 
Linear classification involves finding a hyperplane that separates different classes in a dataset. The Perceptron algorithm is a foundational algorithm in machine learning for training a binary classifier. It operates by adjusting weights based on the misclassifications of input data points. The goal is to minimize classification errors.

**Pseudocode**:
```pseudo
Initialize weights w and bias b to 0
Set learning rate α

for each training example (x, y):
    prediction = sign(dot_product(w, x) + b)
    if prediction != y:
        w = w + α * (y - prediction) * x
        b = b + α * (y - prediction)
```

### 2. Perceptron Convergence, Generalization

**Concepts**: 
The perceptron convergence theorem states that if the data is linearly separable, the perceptron algorithm will converge to a solution after a finite number of updates. Generalization is the model's ability to correctly classify unseen data, which can be influenced by the choice of model and its complexity.

**Pseudocode**:
```pseudo
function perceptron_convergence(X, Y, max_iterations):
    Initialize w and b
    for iter in range(max_iterations):
        for each (x, y) in zip(X, Y):
            prediction = sign(dot_product(w, x) + b)
            if prediction != y:
                update_weights(w, b, x, y)
    return w, b
```

### 3. Maximum Margin Classification

**Concepts**: 
Maximum margin classification aims to find a hyperplane that not only separates the classes but also maximizes the distance (margin) between the hyperplane and the nearest data points from each class. This approach often leads to better generalization on unseen data.

**Pseudocode**:
```pseudo
function maximum_margin_classifier(X, Y):
    Initialize w and b
    # Solve optimization problem to maximize margin
    while not converged:
        for each (x, y) in zip(X, Y):
            if (y * (dot_product(w, x) + b)) < 1:
                # Update weights
                w = w + learning_rate * (y * x)
                b = b + learning_rate * y
    return w, b
```

### 4. Classification Errors, Regularization, Logistic Regression

**Concepts**: 
Classification errors are metrics that measure how many instances are incorrectly classified. Regularization techniques add a penalty term to the loss function to prevent overfitting by discouraging overly complex models. Logistic regression models the probability of class membership and uses a logistic function to constrain predictions between 0 and 1.

**Pseudocode**:
```pseudo
function logistic_regression(X, Y, alpha, lambda):
    Initialize weights w and bias b
    for epoch in range(num_epochs):
        for each (x, y) in zip(X, Y):
            # Sigmoid function
            prediction = 1 / (1 + exp(-dot_product(w, x) - b))
            # Update weights with regularization
            w = w - alpha * (prediction - y) * x + lambda * w
            b = b - alpha * (prediction - y)
    return w, b
```

### 5. Linear Regression, Estimator Bias and Variance, Active Learning

**Concepts**: 
Linear regression seeks to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables by fitting a linear equation. The bias-variance tradeoff describes the balance between the error introduced by the model's assumptions (bias) and the error due to sensitivity to fluctuations in the training set (variance). Active learning refers to techniques that involve querying the most informative data points for labeling to improve model performance with fewer labeled instances.

**Pseudocode**:
```pseudo
function linear_regression(X, Y):
    # Using Normal Equation
    w = (X.T * X)^-1 * X.T * Y
    return w

function active_learning(X, Y, model):
    while not sufficient_accuracy:
        x_new = query_most_informative_point(model)
        y_new = get_label(x_new)
        X.append(x_new)
        Y.append(y_new)
        model = train_model(X, Y)
```

### 6. Active Learning (cont.), Non-linear Predictions, Kernels

**Concepts**: 
Active learning techniques aim to identify the most useful data points to label in order to achieve better performance with less data. Non-linear predictions can be made by transforming the input features into a higher-dimensional space using kernel functions, allowing linear models to capture complex relationships.

**Pseudocode**:
```pseudo
function kernel_function(x1, x2):
    return (dot_product(x1, x2) + 1)^2  # Polynomial kernel

function kernel_regression(X, Y):
    for each x_test in X_test:
        predictions = []
        for each (x, y) in zip(X, Y):
            prediction = kernel_function(x, x_test) * y
            predictions.append(prediction)
        return average(predictions)
```

### 7. Kernel Regression, Kernels

**Concepts**: 
Kernel regression uses kernel functions to create predictions based on the weighted contributions of the training data points. Different kernels can model various types of relationships in the data, such as linear, polynomial, or radial basis functions.

**Pseudocode**:
```pseudo
function kernel_regression(X_train, Y_train, x_test, kernel):
    weighted_sum = 0
    total_weight = 0
    for (x_i, y_i) in zip(X_train, Y_train):
        weight = kernel(x_i, x_test)
        weighted_sum += weight * y_i
        total_weight += weight
    return weighted_sum / total_weight if total_weight > 0 else 0
```

### 8. Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Kernels, Kernel Optimization

**Concepts**: 
Support Vector Machines (SVM) are a powerful class of supervised learning models that seek to find the optimal hyperplane that maximizes the margin between different classes. SVMs can leverage kernel functions to effectively deal with non-linear classification tasks.

**Pseudocode**:
```pseudo
function svm(X, Y, kernel, C):
    # Formulate optimization problem
    Initialize alpha
    for iteration in range(max_iterations):
        for (x_i, y_i) in zip(X, Y):
            # Compute gradient and update alpha
            update_alpha(alpha, x_i, y_i, kernel)
    return alpha
```

### 9. Model Selection

**Concepts**: 
Model selection involves choosing the best model among a set of candidate models. Techniques like cross-validation help assess the model's performance on unseen data by partitioning the training data into subsets for training and validation.

**Pseudocode**:
```pseudo
function model_selection(models, X, Y):
    best_model = None
    best_score = -inf
    for model in models:
        score = cross_validate(model, X, Y)
        if score > best_score:
            best_score = score
            best_model = model
    return best_model
```

### 10. Model Selection Criteria

**Concepts**: 
Model selection criteria such as Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) are statistical measures used to evaluate the quality of models. They penalize model complexity while rewarding goodness of fit, helping to prevent overfitting.

**Pseudocode**:
```pseudo
function evaluate_model(model, X, Y):
    residual_sum_squares = compute_residuals(model, X, Y)
    n = length(Y)
    k = number_of_parameters(model)
    aic = n * log(residual_sum_squares/n) + 2 * k
    bic = n * log(residual_sum_squares/n) + log(n) * k
    return aic, bic
```

### 11. Description Length, Feature Selection

**Concepts**: 
The description length principle states that a simpler model (with a shorter description) is preferred over a more complex one. Feature selection involves identifying and selecting a subset of relevant features for use in model construction, enhancing model interpretability and performance.

**Pseudocode**:
```pseudo
function feature_selection(X, Y):
    selected_features = []
    for feature in all_features:
        if is_relevant(feature, X, Y):
            selected_features.append(feature)
    return selected_features
```

### 12. Combining Classifiers, Boosting

**Concepts**: 
Ensemble methods combine predictions from multiple classifiers to improve performance. Boosting is a specific ensemble technique that sequentially trains classifiers, where each classifier attempts to correct errors made by its predecessors, emphasizing harder-to-classify instances.

**Pseudocode**:
```pseudo
function boosting(X, Y, num_classifiers):
    models = []
    weights = initialize_weights(len(Y))
    for i in range(num_classifiers):
        model = train_classifier(X, Y, weights)
        models.append(model)
        predictions = model.predict(X)
        update_weights(weights, Y, predictions)
    return models
```

### 13. Boosting, Margin, and Complexity

**Concepts**: 
Boosting can improve the margin of classifiers, and understanding the complexity of a model is essential for achieving good generalization. The margin is the distance between the decision boundary and the closest data points, influencing the model's robustness.

**Pseudocode**:
```pseudo
function update

_weights(weights, Y, predictions):
    for i in range(len(Y)):
        if Y[i] != predictions[i]:
            weights[i] *= 2  # Increase weight for misclassified
        else:
            weights[i] *= 0.5  # Decrease weight for correctly classified
```

### 14. Margin and Generalization, Mixture Models

**Concepts**: 
The margin of a classifier can significantly impact its generalization ability. Mixture models assume that the data is generated from a mixture of several distributions, allowing for the modeling of more complex datasets.

**Pseudocode**:
```pseudo
function gaussian_mixture_model(X, num_components):
    # Initialize parameters for each component
    means, covariances = initialize_parameters(num_components)
    for iteration in range(max_iterations):
        responsibilities = compute_responsibilities(X, means, covariances)
        means, covariances = update_parameters(X, responsibilities)
    return means, covariances
```

### 15. Mixtures and the Expectation Maximization (EM) Algorithm

**Concepts**: 
The Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm is used for finding maximum likelihood estimates in models with latent variables. It consists of two steps: the expectation step (E-step) computes the expected value of the log-likelihood, while the maximization step (M-step) updates the parameters to maximize this expectation.

**Pseudocode**:
```pseudo
function em_algorithm(X, num_components):
    means, covariances = initialize_parameters(num_components)
    while not converged:
        responsibilities = e_step(X, means, covariances)
        means, covariances = m_step(X, responsibilities)
    return means, covariances
```

### 16. EM, Regularization, Clustering

**Concepts**: 
Regularization in the EM context helps prevent overfitting by adding a penalty for complexity in the model. Clustering algorithms like K-means can also be viewed through the lens of EM, where clusters represent different components in a mixture model.

**Pseudocode**:
```pseudo
function k_means_em(X, k):
    # Initialize centroids
    centroids = initialize_centroids(X, k)
    while not converged:
        responsibilities = compute_responsibilities(X, centroids)
        centroids = update_centroids(responsibilities)
    return centroids
```

### 17. Clustering

**Concepts**: 
Clustering aims to group similar data points into clusters without prior labels. Common methods include K-means, hierarchical clustering, and DBSCAN. The choice of clustering algorithm can depend on the data characteristics and the intended outcome.

**Pseudocode**:
```pseudo
function k_means(X, k):
    centroids = initialize_centroids(X, k)
    while not converged:
        clusters = assign_clusters(X, centroids)
        centroids = update_centroids(clusters)
    return clusters, centroids
```

### 18. Spectral Clustering, Markov Models

**Concepts**: 
Spectral clustering leverages the eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix of a graph to reduce dimensionality before applying clustering algorithms. Markov models describe systems that transition from one state to another, characterized by transition probabilities.

**Pseudocode**:
```pseudo
function spectral_clustering(X, num_clusters):
    similarity_matrix = compute_similarity(X)
    eigenvalues, eigenvectors = compute_eigen_decomposition(similarity_matrix)
    clusters = k_means(eigenvectors, num_clusters)
    return clusters
```

### 19. Hidden Markov Models (HMMs)

**Concepts**: 
HMMs are statistical models that represent systems where the state is not directly observable (hidden) but can be inferred through observed events. They are widely used in sequence analysis, such as speech and text processing.

**Pseudocode**:
```pseudo
function hmm_forward(observations, states, start_prob, trans_prob, emit_prob):
    # Initialization
    alpha = initialize_alpha(len(observations), len(states))
    for t in range(1, len(observations)):
        for j in range(len(states)):
            for i in range(len(states)):
                alpha[t][j] += alpha[t-1][i] * trans_prob[i][j] * emit_prob[j][observations[t]]
    return sum(alpha[-1])
```

### 20. HMMs (cont.)

**Concepts**: 
Further applications of HMMs include the Baum-Welch algorithm, which estimates the parameters of the model by maximizing the likelihood of the observed data.

**Pseudocode**:
```pseudo
function hmm_baum_welch(observations, states):
    while not converged:
        forward_prob = hmm_forward(observations, states)
        backward_prob = hmm_backward(observations, states)
        update_parameters(forward_prob, backward_prob, states)
```

### 21. Bayesian Networks

**Concepts**: 
Bayesian networks are graphical models that represent a set of variables and their conditional dependencies via a directed acyclic graph (DAG). They enable probabilistic inference and are useful in decision-making under uncertainty.

**Pseudocode**:
```pseudo
function bayesian_network_inference(bn, query_var, evidence):
    # Perform variable elimination or belief propagation
    return marginal_distribution(query_var, evidence)
```

### 22. Learning Bayesian Networks

**Concepts**: 
Learning Bayesian networks involves structure learning (determining the graph structure) and parameter learning (estimating the probabilities associated with the nodes). Various algorithms exist for both tasks, such as constraint-based or score-based methods.

**Pseudocode**:
```pseudo
function learn_bayesian_network(data):
    structure = learn_structure(data)
    parameters = estimate_parameters(data, structure)
    return structure, parameters
```

### 23. Probabilistic Inference

**Concepts**: 
Probabilistic inference is the process of computing the posterior distribution of a variable based on prior knowledge and observed data. Techniques like Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and variational inference are often used.

**Pseudocode**:
```pseudo
function probabilistic_inference(prior, likelihood, evidence):
    posterior = compute_posterior(prior, likelihood, evidence)
    return posterior
```

### Guest Lecture on Collaborative Filtering

**Concepts**: 
Collaborative filtering is a technique used in recommendation systems to predict user preferences based on past interactions and the preferences of similar users. It can be user-based or item-based, focusing on either users' behavior or items' characteristics.

**Pseudocode**:
```pseudo
function collaborative_filtering(user_item_matrix, user_id):
    similar_users = find_similar_users(user_item_matrix, user_id)
    predictions = []
    for item in all_items:
        prediction = predict_rating(similar_users, item)
        predictions.append((item, prediction))
    return sorted(predictions, key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
```
