  - Definition of a normal subgroup, factor groups, the First Isomorphism Theorem, and other isomorphism theorems.
- **Group Actions**:
  - Actions of a group on a set, orbit-stabilizer theorem, applications to counting (Burnside's Lemma), and Sylow theorems.

- **Quotient Rings**:
  - Construction and properties of quotient rings, correspondence theorem for rings.
- **Ring Properties**:
  - Integral domains, division rings, fields, the characteristic of a ring, and examples like \( \mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z} \).
- **Polynomial Rings**:
  - Structure of polynomial rings, the Division Algorithm, the Remainder Theorem, irreducibility criteria, and factorization in polynomial rings over a field.

#### **3. Modules**
- **Introduction to Modules**:
  - Definition of a module over a ring, submodules, quotient modules, and examples like vector spaces (modules over a field).
- **Module Homomorphisms**:
  - Homomorphisms between modules, kernels, and images.
- **Free Modules**:
  - Definition and examples, bases, and rank of free modules.
- **Exact Sequences and Module Homomorphisms**:
  - Short exact sequences, split exact sequences, and applications to module theory.

#### **4. Field Theory (Introduction)**
- **Field Extensions**:
  - Definition of a field extension, examples, and basic properties.
- **Simple Extensions**:
  - Adjoining elements to a field, degree of an extension, and minimal polynomials.
- **Algebraic and Transcendental Elements**:
  - Definition and examples of algebraic and transcendental elements over a field.
- **Splitting Fields and Algebraic Closures**:
  - Definition of a splitting field, the existence of algebraic closures, and examples.

#### **5. Additional Topics (if time permits)**
- **Direct and Semidirect Products**:
  - Definition and examples of direct products, internal direct products, and semidirect products.
- **Classification of Finite Abelian Groups**:
  - Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups, decomposition into cyclic subgroups.
- **The Chinese Remainder Theorem**:
  - Statement and proof, applications in ring theory.
- **Introduction to Galois Theory**:
  - Basic definitions and examples, fundamental theorem of Galois theory (likely very brief, serving as a preview for a more advanced course).

### **Assessment Methods**
- **Problem Sets**: Weekly problem sets to solidify understanding of the concepts.
- **Midterm Exam**: A comprehensive midterm covering all the material discussed up to that point.
- **Final Exam/Project**: A final exam or a research project, which may include proving new results or providing an in-depth exploration of an advanced topic within the scope of the course.

### **Textbooks and References**
- **"Abstract Algebra" by David S. Dummit and Richard M. Foote**: A comprehensive text covering most of the material in this course.
- **"Algebra" by Serge Lang**: A more advanced and abstract treatment, useful for deeper insights and proofs.
- **"Algebra" by Thomas W. Hungerford**: Another rigorous text that provides alternative explanations and additional exercises.

This course would serve as the first half of a full-year sequence, laying the groundwork for more advanced studies in algebra, including more in-depth field theory, Galois theory, and advanced topics like representation theory.
