  - Basic concepts of homotopy, homotopy equivalence, and their implications in topology.

### **Assessment Methods**
- **Problem Sets**: Weekly assignments focusing on proofs, the construction of examples, and the application of topological concepts.
- **Midterm Exam**: A comprehensive examination covering the core concepts and theorems introduced in the first half of the course.
- **Final Exam/Project**: A final exam or a project that could involve deeper exploration of a specific topic, application of topology in another area of mathematics, or the construction of new topological spaces.

### **Textbooks and References**
- **"Topology" by James R. Munkres**: A widely used textbook for both introductory and advanced courses in topology, covering all the foundational topics in detail.
- **"General Topology" by Stephen Willard**: A comprehensive text that delves into both the basic and more advanced topics in general topology, with an emphasis on proofs and rigorous arguments.
- **"Topology" by Klaus Jänich**: A more concise text that offers intuitive explanations alongside rigorous proofs, useful for gaining an intuitive understanding of the subject.
- **"Counterexamples in Topology" by Lynn Arthur Steen and J. Arthur Seebach**: A useful reference for understanding the importance of definitions and theorems by exploring spaces that illustrate the necessity of certain conditions.

This course would lay the groundwork for "Topology II," where students might study more advanced topics such as homology theory, cohomology, advanced covering space theory, and possibly introductory topics in differential topology or geometric topology.
