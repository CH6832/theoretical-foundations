### **Advanced Course on Topology**

This course is designed for graduate-level students with a solid foundation in mathematics. It will explore fundamental and advanced topics in topology with rigorous mathematical proofs and relevant examples.

### **1. Basic Set Theory and Logic (Review)**

**Sets and Functions**

Sets form the foundational language of mathematics. The essential operations include union, intersection, and difference. Given two sets \(A\) and \(B\), their union \(A \cup B\) includes all elements in \(A\) or \(B\), while the intersection \(A \cap B\) contains only elements common to both.

**Functions** between sets are formal mappings. If \(f: A \to B\) is a function, it maps every element in \(A\) to an element in \(B\). A function \(f\) is:
- **Injective (One-to-One)**: For any \(x_1, x_2 \in A\), \(f(x_1) = f(x_2)\) implies \(x_1 = x_2\).
- **Surjective (Onto)**: For every \(y \in B\), there is at least one \(x \in A\) such that \(f(x) = y\).
- **Bijective**: \(f\) is both injective and surjective, creating a one-to-one correspondence between \(A\) and \(B\).

*Example*: The function \(f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}\) given by \(f(x) = 2x + 1\) is bijective. Its inverse \(f^{-1}(x) = \frac{x - 1}{2}\) also demonstrates its bijective nature.

**Relations**

A **relation** \(R\) on a set \(A\) is a subset of \(A \times A\). Key types include:
- **Equivalence Relation**: A relation \(R\) on \(A\) is an equivalence relation if it is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive. For example, equality \(=\) on any set is an equivalence relation.
- **Partial Order**: A relation \(R\) is a partial order if it is reflexive, antisymmetric, and transitive. For instance, the subset relation \(\subseteq\) on the power set of a set is a partial order.

**Cardinality**

Cardinality measures the "size" of sets:
- **Finite Sets**: Have a definite number of elements.
- **Countably Infinite Sets**: Sets like \(\mathbb{N}\) and \(\mathbb{Z}\) can be put into a one-to-one correspondence with the natural numbers.
- **Uncountably Infinite Sets**: Sets like \(\mathbb{R}\) cannot be enumerated like \(\mathbb{N}\). Cantor’s diagonal argument proves that the real numbers are uncountable.

*Example*: Consider the set of real numbers in the interval \([0, 1]\). Cantor’s diagonalization shows that this set is uncountable.

### **2. Topological Spaces and Continuous Functions**

**Definition of a Topological Space**

A **topological space** \( (X, \tau) \) consists of a set \( X \) and a topology \( \tau \), which is a collection of subsets of \(X\) satisfying:
1. Both \(X\) and \(\emptyset\) are in \(\tau\).
2. \(\tau\) is closed under arbitrary unions.
3. \(\tau\) is closed under finite intersections.

*Example*: In \(\mathbb{R}\), the standard topology is generated by open intervals. For a set \(X\), a basis \(\mathcal{B}\) for \(\tau\) is a collection such that every open set in \(\tau\) can be expressed as a union of elements from \(\mathcal{B}\).

**Examples of Topological Spaces**

- **Discrete Topology**: Every subset of \(X\) is open. For \(X = \{1, 2, 3\}\), the discrete topology includes all subsets.
- **Indiscrete Topology**: The only open sets are \(\emptyset\) and \(X\). 

**Continuous Functions**

A function \(f: (X, \tau_X) \to (Y, \tau_Y)\) is **continuous** if the preimage of every open set in \(Y\) is open in \(X\). For instance, the function \(f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}\) defined by \(f(x) = x^2\) is continuous with respect to the standard topologies on \(\mathbb{R}\).

**Bases and Subbases**

A **basis** for a topology \(\tau\) is a collection \(\mathcal{B}\) of open sets such that any open set in \(\tau\) can be expressed as a union of basis elements. A **subbasis** is a collection where finite intersections of elements form a basis for the topology.

*Example*: In \(\mathbb{R}^2\), the collection of open balls forms a basis for the standard topology.

### **3. Convergence, Limits, and Compactness**

**Convergence of Sequences and Nets**

In a topological space \(X\), a sequence \((x_n)\) converges to \(x \in X\) if for every open neighborhood \(U\) of \(x\), there exists an \(N\) such that for all \(n \geq N\), \(x_n \in U\). Nets generalize sequences to directed sets, providing a broader notion of convergence.

*Example*: In \(\mathbb{R}\), the sequence \(x_n = \frac{1}{n}\) converges to 0.

**Limit Points and Closure**

- A point \(x\) is a **limit point** of a set \(A\) if every neighborhood of \(x\) intersects \(A\) in some point other than \(x\) itself.
- The **closure** \(\overline{A}\) of \(A\) includes \(A\) and all its limit points.

*Example*: For \(A = (0, 1)\) in \(\mathbb{R}\), the closure is \([0, 1]\).

**Compactness**

A space \(X\) is **compact** if every open cover has a finite subcover. In metric spaces, compactness is equivalent to being closed and bounded (Heine-Borel Theorem). 

**Tychonoff’s Theorem** asserts that the product of any collection of compact spaces is compact in the product topology.

*Example*: The closed interval \([0, 1]\) is compact in \(\mathbb{R}\).

**Compactness in General Topological Spaces**

A space is **compact** if it satisfies the finite intersection property: every family of closed sets with the finite intersection property has a non-empty intersection.

### **4. Connectedness and Path-Connectedness**

**Connected Spaces**

A space is **connected** if it cannot be partitioned into two non-empty disjoint open sets. The **connected component** is the largest connected subset containing a given point.

*Example*: The space \(\mathbb{R}\) is connected, but \(\mathbb{R} \setminus \{0\}\) is not.

**Path-Connectedness**

A space is **path-connected** if any two points can be joined by a continuous path. Path-connectedness implies connectedness, but the converse is not always true.

**Applications**

The **Intermediate Value Theorem** relies on connectedness. It states that a continuous function on a closed interval that takes on different values at the endpoints must take every value in between.

*Example*: For \(f(x) = x^3 - x\), the function is continuous on \([-1, 1]\), and for \(f(-1) = -2\) and \(f(1) = 0\), the Intermediate Value Theorem guarantees that \(f\) takes every value between -2 and 0.

### **5. Separation Axioms**

**T0, T1, and T2 Spaces**

- **T0 (Kolmogorov)**: For any two distinct points, there is an open set containing one but not the other.
- **T1 (Frechet)**: For any two distinct points, each has an open neighborhood not containing the other.
- **T2 (Hausdorff)**: Any two distinct points have disjoint neighborhoods.

*Example*: The standard topology on \(\mathbb{R}\) is T2, but the trivial topology on \(\mathbb{R}\) is not.

**Regular and Normal Spaces**

- **Regular (T3)**: A space is regular if any point and closed set can be separated by disjoint open sets.
- **Normal (T4)**: A space is normal if any two disjoint closed sets can be separated by disjoint open sets. 

**Urysohn's Lemma** states that in a normal space, for any two non-overlapping closed sets, there is a continuous function mapping the space to \([0,1]\) such that one set maps to 0 and the other to 1.

**Tietze Extension The

orem** extends a continuous function defined on a closed subset of a normal space to the entire space.

### **6. Compactifications**

**One-Point Compactification**

The **one-point compactification** of a non-compact space \(X\) is \(X \cup \{\infty\}\) with a topology where open sets are those that are open in \(X\) or contain \(\infty\) and have a compact complement in \(X\).

*Example*: The one-point compactification of \(\mathbb{R}\) is the extended real line \(\mathbb{R} \cup \{\infty\}\), which is topologically equivalent to a circle.

**Stone-Čech Compactification**

The **Stone-Čech compactification** \(\beta X\) of \(X\) is the space of all ultrafilters on \(X\) with the topology of pointwise convergence. It is the largest compact Hausdorff space in which \(X\) can be embedded densely.

### **7. Product and Quotient Topologies**

**Product Topology**

The **product topology** on \(\prod_{i \in I} X_i\) has a basis consisting of products of open sets from each \(X_i\). Tychonoff’s Theorem asserts that the product of any collection of compact spaces is compact in the product topology.

*Example*: \([0,1] \times [0,1]\) in the product topology of \(\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}\) is compact.

**Quotient Topology**

The **quotient topology** on a space \(Y\) is defined by a map \(q: X \to Y\) where open sets in \(Y\) are those for which \(q^{-1}\) is open in \(X\).

*Example*: The quotient space \(\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}\) has a topology where the points \(x \in \mathbb{R}\) and \(x + n \in \mathbb{R}\) (for \(n \in \mathbb{Z}\)) are identified.

**Comparison of Topologies**

A topology \(\tau\) is **stronger** (or finer) than \(\sigma\) if every open set in \(\sigma\) is also in \(\tau\). Conversely, \(\sigma\) is **weaker** (or coarser) than \(\tau\). Finer topologies have more open sets and thus more separation.

### **8. Metrization Theorems**

**Metric Spaces and Metrization**

A **metric space** is defined by a metric \(d\) satisfying:
1. \(d(x, y) \geq 0\),
2. \(d(x, y) = 0\) if and only if \(x = y\),
3. \(d(x, y) = d(y, x)\),
4. \(d(x, z) \leq d(x, y) + d(y, z)\) (triangle inequality).

**Urysohn Metrization Theorem**

A space is metrizable if and only if it is regular and second-countable. Regularity ensures separation of points from closed sets, while second-countability implies a basis with countable elements.

**Nagata-Smirnov Metrization Theorem**

A space is metrizable if and only if it is regular and every open cover has a locally finite refinement. This provides a more general criterion than Urysohn’s theorem.

### **9. Introduction to Algebraic Topology (if time permits)**

**Fundamental Group**

The **fundamental group** \(\pi_1(X, x_0)\) consists of homotopy classes of loops based at \(x_0\). It captures information about the space's structure by examining how loops can be deformed into each other.

**Covering Spaces**

A **covering space** \(\tilde{X}\) is a space where each point in \(X\) has a neighborhood evenly covered by a projection map \(p: \tilde{X} \to X\). Covering spaces are used to study the fundamental group and other properties.

**Homotopy and Homotopy Equivalence**

**Homotopy** between functions \(f, g: X \to Y\) is a continuous deformation from \(f\) to \(g\). Two spaces \(X\) and \(Y\) are **homotopy equivalent** if there exist continuous maps \(f: X \to Y\) and \(g: Y \to X\) such that \(f \circ g\) is homotopic to the identity map on \(Y\), and \(g \circ f\) is homotopic to the identity map on \(X\).
