### Advanced Real Analysis I: Full Course Content

#### Module 1: Measure Theory

**Sigma-Algebras and Measures**

Measure theory begins with the concept of sigma-algebras and measures, which formalize the idea of "size" in a way that extends the concept of length, area, and volume to more complex settings.

- **Sigma-Algebras**:
  A sigma-algebra \( \mathcal{F} \) on a set \( X \) is a collection of subsets of \( X \) satisfying:
  1. \( X \in \mathcal{F} \),
  2. \( A \in \mathcal{F} \) implies \( A^c \in \mathcal{F} \),
  3. If \( \{A_n\}_{n=1}^\infty \subset \mathcal{F} \), then \( \bigcup_{n=1}^\infty A_n \in \mathcal{F} \).

  **Example**: The Borel sigma-algebra on \( \mathbb{R} \) is generated by the open intervals.

- **Measures**:
  A measure \( \mu \) on \( \mathcal{F} \) is a function \( \mu: \mathcal{F} \to [0, \infty] \) such that:
  1. \( \mu(\emptyset) = 0 \),
  2. \( \mu \) is countably additive: If \( \{A_n\} \) are disjoint sets in \( \mathcal{F} \), then \( \mu \left( \bigcup_{n=1}^\infty A_n \right) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \mu(A_n) \).

  **Example**: The Lebesgue measure \( \lambda \) on \( \mathbb{R} \) assigns \( \lambda([a, b]) = b - a \) for intervals \( [a, b] \).

- **Outer Measures**:
  Given any subset \( A \subseteq X \), the outer measure \( \mu^*(A) \) is defined as:
  \[ \mu^*(A) = \inf \left\{ \sum_{k=1}^\infty \mu(A_k) \mid A \subseteq \bigcup_{k=1}^\infty A_k \text{ and } A_k \in \mathcal{F} \right\}. \]

- **Carathéodory's Extension Theorem**:
  This theorem provides a method to extend a pre-measure defined on an algebra of sets to a measure defined on the sigma-algebra generated by that algebra.

**Measurable Functions**

- **Definition**: A function \( f: X \to \mathbb{R} \) is measurable if \( f^{-1}(B) \in \mathcal{F} \) for every Borel set \( B \subset \mathbb{R} \).

- **Almost Everywhere**: Functions \( f \) and \( g \) are equal almost everywhere if \( \mu(\{ x \mid f(x) \neq g(x) \}) = 0 \).

- **Simple Functions**: A function \( \phi \) is simple if it takes on a finite number of values, and can approximate more complex functions in \( L^p \) spaces.

**Integration with Respect to a Measure**

- **Lebesgue Integral**:
  For a non-negative measurable function \( f \), the Lebesgue integral is:
  \[ \int_X f \, d\mu = \sup \left\{ \int_X \phi \, d\mu \mid \phi \text{ is a simple function and } \phi \leq f \right\}. \]

- **Monotone Convergence Theorem (MCT)**:
  If \( \{f_n\} \) is an increasing sequence of non-negative measurable functions converging to \( f \), then:
  \[ \int_X f = \lim_{n \to \infty} \int_X f_n. \]

- **Fatou’s Lemma**:
  For a sequence of non-negative measurable functions \( \{f_n\} \):
  \[ \int_X \liminf_{n \to \infty} f_n \leq \liminf_{n \to \infty} \int_X f_n. \]

- **Dominated Convergence Theorem (DCT)**:
  If \( \{f_n\} \) is a sequence of measurable functions converging to \( f \) and \( |f_n| \leq g \) for some integrable function \( g \), then:
  \[ \int_X f = \lim_{n \to \infty} \int_X f_n. \]

**Product Measures and Fubini’s Theorem**

- **Product Measures**:
  For measures \( \mu \) and \( \nu \) on \( X \) and \( Y \), the product measure \( \mu \times \nu \) is defined by:
  \[ (\mu \times \nu)(A \times B) = \mu(A) \nu(B). \]

- **Fubini’s Theorem**:
  For integrable functions \( f \) on \( X \times Y \):
  \[ \int_X \int_Y f(x, y) \, d\nu(y) \, d\mu(x) = \int_Y \int_X f(x, y) \, d\mu(x) \, d\nu(y). \]

- **Tonelli’s Theorem**:
  For non-negative functions:
  \[ \int_X \int_Y f(x, y) \, d\nu(y) \, d\mu(x) = \int_{X \times Y} f \, d(\mu \times \nu). \]

#### Module 2: \(L^p\) Spaces

**Definitions and Examples**

- **\(L^p\) Spaces**:
  For \( 1 \leq p < \infty \):
  \[ \|f\|_p = \left( \int_X |f(x)|^p \, d\mu(x) \right)^{1/p}. \]
  For \( p = \infty \):
  \[ \|f\|_\infty = \text{ess sup}_{x \in X} |f(x)|. \]

- **Examples**:
  - **\(L^1\)**: Space of integrable functions.
  - **\(L^2\)**: Space of square-integrable functions. For \( f \in L^2(X, \mu) \), \(\|f\|_2^2 = \int_X |f(x)|^2 \, d\mu(x)\).

**Completeness and Duality**

- **Completeness**:
  \( L^p \) spaces are complete, meaning every Cauchy sequence in \( L^p \) converges to a function in \( L^p \).

- **Hölder’s Inequality**:
  For functions \( f \in L^p \) and \( g \in L^q \):
  \[ \int_X |f(x) g(x)| \, d\mu \leq \|f\|_p \|g\|_q. \]

- **Dual Spaces**:
  The dual space of \( L^p(X, \mu) \) is \( L^q(X, \mu) \), where \( \frac{1}{p} + \frac{1}{q} = 1 \).

**Convergence in \(L^p\) Spaces**

- **Almost Everywhere Convergence**:
  \( f_n \to f \) almost everywhere if \( \mu(\{x \mid f_n(x) \neq f(x)\}) \to 0 \).

- **Convergence in Measure**:
  \( f_n \to f \) in measure if for every \( \epsilon > 0 \):
  \[ \mu(\{ x \mid |f_n(x) - f(x)| \geq \epsilon \}) \to 0. \]

- **Convergence in \(L^p\) Norm**:
  \( f_n \to f \) in \(L^p\) norm if \( \|f_n - f\|_p \to 0 \).

#### Module 3: Differentiation and Integration

**Differentiation of Measures**

- **Radon-Nikodym Theorem**:
  If \( \nu \) is absolutely continuous with respect to \( \mu \), then there exists a function \( \frac{d\nu}{d\mu} \) such that:
  \[ \nu(A) = \int_A \frac{d\nu}{d\mu} \, d\mu \]
  for all \( A \in \mathcal{F} \).

**Functions of Bounded Variation**

- **Definition**:
  A function \( f \) is of bounded variation on \( [a, b] \) if the total variation:
  \[ V(f) = \sup \sum

_{i=1}^n |f(x_i) - f(x_{i-1})| \]
  is finite, where the supremum is taken over all partitions \( a = x_0 < x_1 < \cdots < x_n = b \).

- **Jordan Decomposition Theorem**:
  Every function of bounded variation can be decomposed into the difference of two increasing functions.

**The Riesz Representation Theorem**

- **Riesz Representation Theorem**:
  For any continuous linear functional \( \phi \) on \( C_0(\mathbb{R}^n) \), there exists a unique regular Borel measure \( \mu \) such that:
  \[ \phi(f) = \int_{\mathbb{R}^n} f(x) \, d\mu(x) \]
  for all \( f \in C_0(\mathbb{R}^n) \).

#### Module 4: Fourier Analysis (Introduction)

**Fourier Series**

- **Fourier Series**:
  The Fourier series of a function \( f \) defined on \( [0, 2\pi] \) is given by:
  \[ f(x) \sim \frac{a_0}{2} + \sum_{n=1}^\infty \left(a_n \cos(nx) + b_n \sin(nx)\right), \]
  where:
  \[ a_n = \frac{1}{\pi} \int_{0}^{2\pi} f(x) \cos(nx) \, dx, \]
  \[ b_n = \frac{1}{\pi} \int_{0}^{2\pi} f(x) \sin(nx) \, dx. \]

- **Convergence Theorems**:
  - **Dirichlet’s Theorem**: If \( f \) is piecewise continuous, then the Fourier series converges to \( f \) at points where \( f \) is continuous and to the average of the left-hand and right-hand limits where \( f \) is discontinuous.

- **Parseval’s Identity**:
  \[ \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_{0}^{2\pi} |f(x)|^2 \, dx = \frac{a_0^2}{4} + \sum_{n=1}^\infty (a_n^2 + b_n^2). \]

**Fourier Transform**

- **Definition**:
  The Fourier transform of a function \( f \) is:
  \[ \hat{f}(\xi) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty f(x) e^{-i \xi x} \, dx. \]

- **Properties**:
  - Linearity: \( \widehat{af + bg} = a\hat{f} + b\hat{g} \).
  - Scaling: \( \widehat{f(\alpha x)}(\xi) = \frac{1}{|\alpha|} \hat{f}\left(\frac{\xi}{\alpha}\right) \).
  - Convolution Theorem: \( \widehat{f * g} = \hat{f} \cdot \hat{g} \).

- **Inversion Theorem**:
  \[ f(x) = \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_{-\infty}^\infty \hat{f}(\xi) e^{i \xi x} \, d\xi. \]

- **Plancherel’s Theorem**:
  \[ \int_{-\infty}^\infty |f(x)|^2 \, dx = \int_{-\infty}^\infty |\hat{f}(\xi)|^2 \, d\xi. \]

#### Module 5: Advanced Topics in Integration

**Signed Measures and Hahn Decomposition**

- **Signed Measures**:
  A signed measure can be decomposed into a positive measure \( \mu^+ \) and a negative measure \( \mu^- \) such that:
  \[ \mu = \mu^+ - \mu^-. \]

- **Hahn Decomposition Theorem**:
  For any signed measure \( \mu \), there exists a partition \( X = P \cup N \) where \( P \) is a positive set and \( N \) is a negative set with:
  \[ \mu(A) \geq 0 \text{ for all } A \subset P, \]
  \[ \mu(A) \leq 0 \text{ for all } A \subset N. \]

**Complex Measures and Polar Decomposition**

- **Complex Measures**:
  A complex measure \( \mu \) can be expressed as:
  \[ \mu = \nu e^{i \theta}, \]
  where \( \nu \) is a positive measure and \( e^{i \theta} \) is a complex exponential function.

- **Polar Decomposition**:
  This theorem states that any complex measure can be written as the product of a positive measure and a complex-valued function with unit modulus.

**Lebesgue-Radon-Nikodym Decomposition**

- **Lebesgue-Radon-Nikodym Decomposition**:
  Given a measure \( \mu \) and a measure \( \nu \), there exists a unique decomposition:
  \[ \mu = \mu_{ac} + \mu_{sing}, \]
  where \( \mu_{ac} \) is absolutely continuous with respect to \( \nu \), and \( \mu_{sing} \) is singular with respect to \( \nu \).

#### Module 6: Functional Analysis Basics (if time permits)

**Introduction to Banach and Hilbert Spaces**

- **Banach Spaces**:
  A Banach space is a normed vector space that is complete with respect to the norm. For example, \( L^p \) spaces for \( 1 \leq p < \infty \) are Banach spaces.

- **Hilbert Spaces**:
  A Hilbert space is a complete inner product space. Examples include \( L^2 \) spaces, where the inner product is defined as:
  \[ \langle f, g \rangle = \int_X f(x) \overline{g(x)} \, d\mu(x). \]

- **Riesz Representation Theorem**:
  In Hilbert spaces, every continuous linear functional can be represented as an inner product with a fixed vector.

**Bounded Linear Operators**

- **Definition**:
  A bounded linear operator \( T \) on a Banach space \( X \) satisfies:
  \[ \|T(x)\| \leq C \|x\| \]
  for some constant \( C \).

- **Examples**:
  - **Identity Operator**: \( I(x) = x \), which is bounded with norm 1.
  - **Compact Operators**: Operators that map bounded sets to relatively compact sets.

    double sum = 0.5 * (f(a) + f(b));
    
    for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
        double x = a + i * h;
        sum += f(x);
    }
    
    return sum * h;
}

int main() {

    fftw_free(out);
}

    computeFourierTransform(signal, spectrum);
