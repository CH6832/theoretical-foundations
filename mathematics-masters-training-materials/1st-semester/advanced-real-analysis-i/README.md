- **Completeness and Duality**:
  - Proof that \( L^p \) spaces are Banach spaces, Hölder’s and Minkowski’s inequalities, and the dual spaces of \( L^p \).
- **Convergence in \( L^p \) Spaces**:
  - Different modes of convergence: almost everywhere, in measure, and in \( L^p \) norm. Relations between these modes of convergence.

#### **3. Differentiation and Integration**
- **Differentiation of Measures**:
  - Radon-Nikodym Theorem, absolute continuity of measures, and the concept of singular measures.
  - Applications: differentiation of functions and Lebesgue’s Differentiation Theorem.

  - Definition and properties, the Jordan decomposition theorem, and connection with absolutely continuous functions.
- **The Riesz Representation Theorem**:
  - Riesz representation theorem for linear functionals on \( C_0(\mathbb{R}^n) \), applications to measure theory.

#### **4. Fourier Analysis (Introduction)**
- **Fourier Series**:
  - Basics of Fourier series, convergence theorems, Parseval’s identity, and applications to solving PDEs.
- **Fourier Transform**:
  - Definition of the Fourier transform, basic properties, inversion theorem, and the Plancherel theorem.
  - Applications of Fourier analysis in solving differential equations and in signal processing.

#### **5. Advanced Topics in Integration**
- **Signed Measures and the Hahn Decomposition**:
  - Signed measures, the Hahn decomposition theorem, and the Jordan decomposition of signed measures.
- **Complex Measures and the Polar Decomposition**:
  - Complex measures, total variation, and the polar decomposition of complex measures.
- **The Lebesgue-Radon-Nikodym Decomposition**:
  - Decomposition of measures into absolutely continuous and singular parts, implications for integration and differentiation.

#### **6. Functional Analysis Basics (if time permits)**
- **Introduction to Banach and Hilbert Spaces**:
  - Brief introduction to Banach spaces, examples, and applications in analysis.
  - Introduction to Hilbert spaces, orthonormal bases, and the Riesz Representation Theorem for Hilbert spaces.
- **Bounded Linear Operators**:
  - Definition, examples, and basic properties of bounded linear operators on Banach and Hilbert spaces.

### **Assessment Methods**
- **Problem Sets**: Weekly rigorous problem sets, focusing on proofs and the application of theory to solve complex problems.
- **Midterm Exam**: A comprehensive midterm exam testing understanding and ability to apply the concepts covered in the course.
- **Final Exam/Project**: A final exam or an in-depth project, possibly involving the exploration of an advanced topic or application of real analysis to a related field.

### **Textbooks and References**
- **"Real Analysis: Modern Techniques and Their Applications" by Gerald B. Folland**: A comprehensive and rigorous treatment of measure theory and integration.
- **"Real and Complex Analysis" by Walter Rudin**: A classic text offering a thorough exploration of real and complex analysis, often used for deeper insights.
- **"Measure Theory" by Paul R. Halmos**: An accessible introduction to measure theory with clear explanations and detailed examples.
- **"Fourier Analysis: An Introduction" by Elias M. Stein and Rami Shakarchi**: A text focusing on Fourier series and Fourier transforms, introducing applications of these topics in analysis.

This course would be the first part of a two-semester sequence, with "Advanced Real Analysis II" likely covering topics such as advanced functional analysis, spectral theory, and additional aspects of harmonic analysis.
