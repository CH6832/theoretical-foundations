#### **7. The Argument Principle and Rouché's Theorem**
- **Argument Principle**:
  - The relationship between the number of zeros and poles of a meromorphic function inside a contour and the change in argument around the contour.
- **Rouché's Theorem**:
  - Statement and proof of Rouché's Theorem, applications to counting zeros of polynomials and other analytic functions.

#### **8. Harmonic Functions**
- **Harmonic Functions**:
  - Definition and basic properties, the mean value property, and the maximum principle.

  - Introduction to solving the Dirichlet problem for Laplace's equation on a disk.

#### **9. Introduction to Riemann Surfaces (if time permits)**
- **Multi-Valued Functions and Branch Points**:
  - Introduction to the concept of a Riemann surface as a means to study multi-valued functions like the square root or logarithm.
  - Basic examples and the idea of covering spaces.

### **Assessment Methods**
- **Problem Sets**: Weekly assignments that include proof-based problems and computations to solidify understanding.
- **Midterm Exam**: A comprehensive test on the topics covered in the first half of the course.
- **Final Exam/Project**: A final assessment that could involve a traditional exam or a project exploring an advanced topic or application of complex analysis.

### **Textbooks and References**
- **"Complex Analysis" by Elias M. Stein and Rami Shakarchi**: A modern and comprehensive text, covering all essential topics with clear explanations and examples.
- **"Complex Analysis" by Lars Ahlfors**: A classic text, rigorous and detailed, often used for deeper theoretical insights.
- **"Functions of One Complex Variable" by John B. Conway**: Another standard graduate text, particularly well-suited for those interested in analysis.
- **"Visual Complex Analysis" by Tristan Needham**: A more geometric and intuitive approach to complex analysis, which can be very helpful in gaining a deeper understanding of the subject.

This course, "Complex Analysis I," would typically be followed by "Complex Analysis II," where students might explore topics like advanced Riemann surfaces, elliptic functions, more detailed studies of conformal mappings, and possibly introductory topics in several complex variables.
