Certainly! Here’s an expanded version of the Advanced Complex Analysis course, incorporating deeper insights into each topic and additional advanced concepts. This version is aimed at a master’s level with a strong focus on rigorous mathematical formulations and applications, akin to MIT-level coursework.

### **Advanced Complex Analysis: Extended Course Content**

#### **1. Complex Numbers and the Complex Plane**

Complex numbers extend the real number system by introducing an imaginary unit \(i\), where \(i^2 = -1\). A complex number \( z \) is expressed as \( z = x + iy \), where \(x\) and \(y\) are real numbers. The geometric representation of \(z\) in the complex plane positions it at the point \((x, y)\).

In algebra, complex numbers can be manipulated through addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. For example, the product of two complex numbers \(z_1 = x_1 + iy_1\) and \(z_2 = x_2 + iy_2\) is computed as:

\[
z_1 \cdot z_2 = (x_1 x_2 - y_1 y_2) + i (x_1 y_2 + y_1 x_2).
\]

The polar form of a complex number is given by:

\[
z = r e^{i\theta},
\]

where \(r = |z| = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\) is the modulus and \(\theta = \arg(z)\) is the argument, which can be found using \( \theta = \arctan\left(\frac{y}{x}\right) \). This form is particularly useful for simplifying multiplication and division of complex numbers.

**Topology of the Complex Plane:**  
The complex plane \(\mathbb{C}\) can be equipped with the standard topology inherited from \(\mathbb{R}^2\). An open set in \(\mathbb{C}\) is one where every point has a neighborhood entirely contained within the set. Closed sets contain all their limit points. A set is connected if it cannot be partitioned into two disjoint non-empty open subsets.

For example, the set of all complex numbers with real part greater than zero is open, while the set of all complex numbers with absolute value less than or equal to one is closed.

#### **2. Analytic Functions**

An analytic function, or holomorphic function, is a function \( f: \mathbb{C} \to \mathbb{C} \) that is complex differentiable in a neighborhood of every point in its domain. A function \(f(z)\) is analytic if it satisfies the Cauchy-Riemann equations:

\[
\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial v}{\partial y} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} = -\frac{\partial v}{\partial x},
\]

where \( f(z) = u(x, y) + iv(x, y) \) and \( u \) and \( v \) are the real and imaginary parts of \(f\), respectively.

**Harmonic Functions:**  
A function \( u(x, y) \) is harmonic if it satisfies Laplace’s equation:

\[
\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y^2} = 0.
\]

Harmonic functions are intimately related to analytic functions, as the real and imaginary parts of an analytic function are harmonic. The harmonic conjugate of \( u \), denoted \( v \), satisfies:

\[
\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial v}{\partial y} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} = -\frac{\partial v}{\partial x}.
\]

**Elementary Functions:**  
- **Complex Exponential:** Defined as \( e^z = e^{x + iy} = e^x (\cos y + i \sin y) \).  
- **Complex Logarithm:** Given by \( \log(z) = \ln |z| + i \arg(z) \), where \(\arg(z)\) is typically taken in the principal value range \((-\pi, \pi]\).  
- **Complex Trigonometric Functions:** \(\sin(z) = \frac{e^{iz} - e^{-iz}}{2i}\) and \(\cos(z) = \frac{e^{iz} + e^{-iz}}{2}\).  
- **Complex Hyperbolic Functions:** \(\sinh(z) = \frac{e^z - e^{-z}}{2}\) and \(\cosh(z) = \frac{e^z + e^{-z}}{2}\).

#### **3. Complex Differentiation**

A function \( f \) is complex-differentiable at a point \( z_0 \) if:

\[
\lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(z_0 + h) - f(z_0)}{h}
\]

exists and is independent of the direction in which \( h \) approaches zero. This implies that the function is analytic at \( z_0 \). The higher-order derivatives of \( f \) are given by:

\[
f^{(n)}(z) = \frac{n!}{2\pi i} \int_{\gamma} \frac{f(w)}{(w - z)^{n+1}} \, dw,
\]

where \( \gamma \) is a contour around \( z \) within the domain of analyticity.

**Power Series Representation:**  
An analytic function \( f \) can be represented locally around \( z_0 \) by its Taylor series:

\[
f(z) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{f^{(n)}(z_0)}{n!} (z - z_0)^n,
\]

with radius of convergence \( R \) defined by:

\[
\frac{1}{R} = \limsup_{n \to \infty} |a_n|^{1/n}.
\]

The Laurent series extends this representation to include terms with negative powers for functions with isolated singularities:

\[
f(z) = \sum_{n=-\infty}^\infty a_n (z - z_0)^n.
\]

#### **4. Complex Integration**

Contour integration involves integrating a function \( f \) along a contour \( \gamma \). For a contour \( \gamma \) parameterized by \( z(t) \) from \( t = a \) to \( t = b \):

\[
\int_{\gamma} f(z) \, dz = \int_{a}^{b} f(z(t)) \frac{dz(t)}{dt} \, dt.
\]

**Cauchy’s Theorem:**  
If \( f \) is analytic within and on a closed contour \( \gamma \):

\[
\int_{\gamma} f(z) \, dz = 0.
\]

**Cauchy’s Integral Formula:**  
For an analytic function \( f \) within a closed contour \( \gamma \) and any point \( z_0 \) inside \( \gamma \):

\[
f(z_0) = \frac{1}{2\pi i} \int_{\gamma} \frac{f(z)}{z - z_0} \, dz.
\]

This formula extends to higher derivatives:

\[
f^{(n)}(z_0) = \frac{n!}{2\pi i} \int_{\gamma} \frac{f(z)}{(z - z_0)^{n+1}} \, dz.
\]

**Liouville’s Theorem:**  
Any bounded entire function must be constant. This result follows from the fact that a non-constant entire function must be unbounded.

**Maximum Modulus Principle:**  
If \( f \) is analytic in a domain and non-constant, then \( |f(z)| \) attains its maximum on the boundary of the domain.

#### **5. Series and Residues**

**Laurent Series:**  
For a function \( f \) with a singularity at \( z_0 \), the Laurent series expansion is:

\[
f(z) = \sum_{n=-\infty}^{-1} \frac{a_n}{(z - z_0)^{n}} + \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_n (z - z_0)^{n}.
\]

**Residue Theorem:**  
For a function \( f \) with isolated singularities inside a closed contour \( \gamma \):

\[
\int_{\gamma} f(z) \, dz = 2\pi i \sum \text{Res}(f, z_k),
\]

where \( \text{Res}(f, z_k) \) denotes the residue at the singularity \( z_k \). Residues at simple poles can be computed as:

\[
\text{Res}(f, z_0) = \lim_{z \to z_0} (z - z_0) f(z).
\]

**Classification of Singularities:**

- **Removable Singularity:** If \( \lim_{z \to z_0} f(z) \) exists.
- **Pole:** If \( f(z) \) behaves like \( \frac{1}{(z - z_0)^n} \) near \( z_0 \) for some \( n \).
- **Essential Singularity:** If \( (z -

 z_0)^n f(z) \) does not approach zero for any \( n \).

**Casorati-Weierstrass Theorem:**  
Near an essential singularity \( z_0 \), \( f(z) \) takes on every complex value, with at most one exception, infinitely often.

#### **6. Conformal Mappings**

**Basic Concepts:**  
A function \( f \) is conformal if it preserves angles, which implies \( f \) is analytic and its derivative is non-zero. A conformal map locally transforms small regions into similar shapes.

**Riemann Mapping Theorem:**  
Any non-empty simply connected open subset of \( \mathbb{C} \) that is not the entire plane can be conformally mapped to the open unit disk. This theorem is fundamental for understanding the structure of complex analytic functions and their applications.

**Applications:**  
Conformal mappings are used in solving problems in potential theory, fluid dynamics, and electrostatics by transforming complex domains into simpler ones.

#### **7. The Argument Principle and Rouché's Theorem**

**Argument Principle:**  
For a meromorphic function \( f \) and a closed contour \( \gamma \), the change in the argument of \( f(z) \) as \( z \) traces \( \gamma \) relates to the number of zeros and poles inside \( \gamma \):

\[
N - P = \frac{1}{2\pi i} \int_{\gamma} \frac{f'(z)}{f(z)} \, dz.
\]

**Rouché's Theorem:**  
If \( f \) and \( g \) are analytic in a domain and \( |f(z) - g(z)| < |f(z)| \) on a contour \( \gamma \), then \( f \) and \( g \) have the same number of zeros inside \( \gamma \). This theorem is used for counting zeros of analytic functions and for proving the existence of roots in various applications.

#### **8. Harmonic Functions**

**Harmonic Functions:**  
Harmonic functions satisfy:

\[
\Delta u = 0,
\]

where \(\Delta\) is the Laplacian operator. They exhibit the mean value property, meaning the value of \(u\) at any point is the average of its values on any circle centered at that point.

**Dirichlet Problem:**  
The Dirichlet problem involves finding a harmonic function on a domain that takes prescribed values on the boundary. This can be approached using methods like conformal mapping, potential theory, and variational methods.

#### **9. Introduction to Riemann Surfaces**

**Multi-Valued Functions and Branch Points:**  
Functions like \( \sqrt{z} \) and \( \log(z) \) are multi-valued due to their nature. A Riemann surface provides a way to "unfold" these functions into single-valued functions on a surface. For example, the Riemann surface of \( \log(z) \) consists of an infinite sheeted surface that covers the complex plane.

**Covering Spaces:**  
A covering space is a space that "covers" another space such that locally it looks like a product of the base space and a discrete set. For the Riemann surface of \( \sqrt{z} \), it covers the complex plane with two sheets.
