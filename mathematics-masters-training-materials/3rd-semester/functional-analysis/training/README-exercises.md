Hereâ€™s a set of advanced exercises for a course in functional analysis at the MIT level. These exercises cover various topics from normed spaces and Banach spaces to operator algebras and advanced applications.

### **Normed Spaces and Banach Spaces**

1. **Verify Norm Properties:**
   - Show that the function \( \|f\|_p = \left( \int_{[0,1]} |f(x)|^p \, dx \right)^{1/p} \) defines a norm on \( L^p([0,1]) \) for \( 1 \leq p < \infty \). Verify non-negativity, homogeneity, and the triangle inequality.

2. **Find a Basis:**
   - In the Banach space \( c_0 \) (the space of sequences converging to 0), show that the standard basis \( \{e_n\} \) where \( e_n \) is the sequence with 1 at the \( n \)-th position and 0 elsewhere, is not a Schauder basis.

3. **Subspaces and Quotients:**
   - Given \( \mathbb{R}^3 \) with the \( \ell^2 \)-norm, find the quotient space \( \mathbb{R}^3 / \text{span}\{ (1,1,1) \} \). Describe its norm and compute its dimension.

4. **Complete a Space:**
   - Prove that the space of continuous functions on \([0,1]\) with the supremum norm is a Banach space. Show that it is complete by considering a Cauchy sequence of continuous functions.

5. **Uniform Boundedness Principle:**
   - Let \( \{T_\alpha\}_{\alpha \in A} \) be a family of linear operators from a Banach space \( X \) to \( \mathbb{R} \) such that \( \sup_{\alpha \in A} |T_\alpha(x)| \leq C \|x\| \) for some \( C \) and for all \( x \in X \). Prove that \( \sup_{\alpha \in A} \|T_\alpha\| < \infty \).

### **Hilbert Spaces**

6. **Orthogonal Projections:**
   - In \( \mathbb{R}^3 \) with the standard dot product, find the orthogonal projection of the vector \( v = (1, 2, 3) \) onto the subspace spanned by \( (1, 1, 0) \) and \( (0, 1, 1) \).

7. **Hilbert's Projection Theorem:**
   - Prove Hilbert's Projection Theorem in \( \mathbb{R}^n \): Given a closed subspace \( M \) of \( \mathbb{R}^n \), show that there exists a unique orthogonal projection \( P \) from \( \mathbb{R}^n \) onto \( M \).

8. **Orthonormal Basis:**
   - Show that the set \( \{ e_n \} \) where \( e_n = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (1, \ldots, 1, 0, \ldots) \) (with \( 1 \) in the first \( n \) positions and \( 0 \) elsewhere) forms an orthonormal system in \( \ell^2 \). 

9. **Adjoint Operator:**
   - Given a bounded linear operator \( T: \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}^2 \) defined by \( T(x_1, x_2) = (x_1 + x_2, 2x_2) \), find its adjoint operator \( T^* \).

10. **Spectral Theorem for Compact Operators:**
    - Prove the Spectral Theorem for compact self-adjoint operators on \( \ell^2 \): show that every compact self-adjoint operator can be diagonalized.

### **Linear Operators and Their Properties**

11. **Bounded Linear Operators:**
    - Prove that the operator \( T: L^2([0,1]) \to L^2([0,1]) \) defined by \( (Tf)(x) = \int_0^x f(t) \, dt \) is bounded. Compute \( \|T\| \).

12. **Compact Operators:**
    - Show that the operator \( T: L^2([0,1]) \to L^2([0,1]) \) defined by \( (Tf)(x) = \int_0^1 \min(x,t) f(t) \, dt \) is compact.

13. **Fredholm Operators:**
    - Consider the operator \( T: \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}^2 \) given by \( T(x_1, x_2) = (x_1, 0) \). Compute its kernel, cokernel, and index.

14. **Spectrum of an Operator:**
    - For the operator \( T: \ell^2 \to \ell^2 \) defined by \( (Te)_n = \frac{1}{n} e_n \), where \( \{e_n\} \) is the standard orthonormal basis, find the spectrum of \( T \).

15. **Perturbation Theory:**
    - Let \( T \) be a bounded linear operator on a Hilbert space and \( T' = T + \epsilon I \) where \( \epsilon \) is a small scalar. Show that the spectrum of \( T' \) is close to the spectrum of \( T \).

### **Banach Algebras and Operator Algebras**

16. **Banach Algebras:**
    - Prove that the space \( C([0,1]) \) with pointwise multiplication and norm \( \|f\|_\infty = \sup_{x \in [0,1]} |f(x)| \) is a Banach algebra.

17. **Gelfand-Naimark Theorem:**
    - Use the Gelfand-Naimark Theorem to show that any commutative Banach algebra with identity is isometrically isomorphic to \( C(K) \) for some compact Hausdorff space \( K \).

18. **C*-Algebras:**
    - Prove that the space of all bounded linear operators on a Hilbert space \( H \), with operator norm and adjoint operation, is a C*-algebra.

19. **Von Neumann Algebras:**
    - Show that the algebra of all bounded operators on a Hilbert space \( H \), equipped with the weak operator topology, is a von Neumann algebra.

20. **Compact Operators in C*-Algebras:**
    - Prove that if \( A \) is a C*-algebra, the set of compact operators forms a closed two-sided ideal in \( A \).

### **Functional Analysis in Dual Spaces**

21. **Duality Theory:**
    - Prove that the dual of \( \ell^1 \) is \( \ell^\infty \) and describe the isometric isomorphism between these spaces.

22. **Banach-Alaoglu Theorem:**
    - Use the Banach-Alaoglu Theorem to show that the closed unit ball in \( \ell^1 \) is compact in the weak-* topology.

23. **Weak-* Topology:**
    - For \( X = L^1([0,1]) \), describe the weak-* topology on \( X^* \) and show that it is not the same as the norm topology.

24. **Duality in Hilbert Spaces:**
    - Verify the Riesz Representation Theorem in \( L^2([0,1]) \): given a bounded linear functional, find the corresponding element in \( L^2([0,1]) \) that represents this functional.

25. **Weak and Strong Convergence:**
    - Show that if \( x_n \to x \) strongly in a Hilbert space \( H \), then \( x_n \to x \) weakly, but the converse is not always true.

### **Advanced Topics and Applications**

26. **Distribution Theory:**
    - Compute the distributional derivative of the Dirac delta function \( \delta(x) \) and show how it acts on test functions in \( C_c^\infty(\mathbb{R}) \).

27. **Partial Differential Equations:**
    - Use Sobolev spaces to show the existence of weak solutions to the Poisson equation \( -\Delta u = f \) with appropriate boundary conditions.

28. **Nonlinear Functional Analysis:**
    - Apply Banach's Contraction Principle to prove the existence and uniqueness of solutions to the nonlinear differential equation \( x' = f(x) \) where \( f \) is a contraction mapping.

29. **Operator Theory:**
    - Analyze the perturbation of the operator \( T \) on \( \ell^2 \) defined by \( (Te)_n = e_{n+1} \) and show how the spectrum of \( T \) changes under a small perturbation.

30. **Applications in Quantum Mechanics:**
    - Using the spectral theorem, solve for the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the Hamiltonian operator in a quantum harmonic oscillator model.

These exercises cover a wide range of topics and should provide a rigorous understanding of advanced functional analysis concepts.
