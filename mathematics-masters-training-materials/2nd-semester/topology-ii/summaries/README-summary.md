### **Algebraic Topology**

**Fundamental Group and Covering Spaces**

**Fundamental Group**: 
The fundamental group of a topological space \( X \), denoted \( \pi_1(X, x_0) \), is a fundamental concept in algebraic topology. It is defined as the set of homotopy classes of loops based at a point \( x_0 \) in \( X \). Formally, given a topological space \( X \) and a base point \( x_0 \in X \), a loop is a continuous function \( f: [0,1] \to X \) such that \( f(0) = f(1) = x_0 \). Two loops \( f \) and \( g \) are homotopic if there exists a continuous function \( F: [0,1] \times [0,1] \to X \) such that \( F(t,0) = f(t) \), \( F(t,1) = g(t) \), and \( F(0,s) = F(1,s) = x_0 \). The set of these equivalence classes forms a group under concatenation of loops.

**Example**: For the circle \( S^1 \), the fundamental group \( \pi_1(S^1) \) is isomorphic to the integers \( \mathbb{Z} \). This is because a loop on \( S^1 \) can be classified by the number of times it winds around the circle, which can be counted by an integer.

**Covering Spaces**:
A covering space \( p: \tilde{X} \to X \) is a map such that for every point \( x \in X \), there exists an open neighborhood \( U \) around \( x \) where \( p^{-1}(U) \) is a disjoint union of open sets in \( \tilde{X} \), each of which is homeomorphic to \( U \) under \( p \). 

**Example**: The map \( p: \mathbb{R} \to S^1 \) given by \( p(t) = e^{2 \pi i t} \) is a covering map. Here, \( \mathbb{R} \) covers \( S^1 \) infinitely many times.

**The Fundamental Theorem of Covering Spaces**:
The fundamental group of the base space \( X \) is isomorphic to the group of deck transformations (automorphisms) of the covering space \( \tilde{X} \). For a covering space \( p: \tilde{X} \to X \), the fundamental group \( \pi_1(X, x_0) \) is isomorphic to the group of deck transformations of \( \tilde{X} \) that preserve the base point.

**Homotopy and Homotopy Theory**

**Homotopy**:
Two maps \( f, g: X \to Y \) are homotopic if there exists a continuous function \( H: X \times [0,1] \to Y \) such that \( H(x,0) = f(x) \) and \( H(x,1) = g(x) \). The map \( H \) is called a homotopy between \( f \) and \( g \).

**Homotopy Equivalence**:
Two spaces \( X \) and \( Y \) are homotopy equivalent if there exist continuous maps \( f: X \to Y \) and \( g: Y \to X \) such that \( f \circ g \) is homotopic to the identity map on \( Y \) and \( g \circ f \) is homotopic to the identity map on \( X \). This implies that \( X \) and \( Y \) have the same homotopy type.

**Homotopy Groups**:
The \( n \)-th homotopy group \( \pi_n(X, x_0) \) of a space \( X \) is defined as the set of homotopy classes of maps from the \( n \)-dimensional sphere \( S^n \) to \( X \), based at \( x_0 \). The group operation is given by the concatenation of maps.

**Simplicial and Singular Homology**

**Simplicial Homology**:
A simplicial complex \( K \) is a set of simplices (vertices, edges, faces) that are glued together in a combinatorial fashion. A \( k \)-simplex is the generalization of a triangle or tetrahedron to \( k \) dimensions.

**Chains, Cycles, and Boundaries**:
Chains are formal sums of simplices. A \( k \)-chain is a linear combination of \( k \)-simplices. A cycle is a \( k \)-chain whose boundary is zero. A boundary is a \( (k+1) \)-chain that can be expressed as the boundary of a \( (k+1) \)-chain.

**Homology Groups**:
The \( k \)-th homology group \( H_k(K) \) of a simplicial complex \( K \) is the quotient of the group of \( k \)-cycles by the group of \( k \)-boundaries. This group captures the \( k \)-dimensional holes in the complex.

**Singular Homology**:
Singular homology generalizes simplicial homology to arbitrary topological spaces. A singular \( k \)-simplex is a continuous map \( \sigma: \Delta^k \to X \), where \( \Delta^k \) is the standard \( k \)-simplex. Singular chains are formal sums of these singular simplices.

**Comparison**:
Simplicial homology is defined for simplicial complexes, while singular homology is defined for arbitrary topological spaces. Both theories yield isomorphic homology groups for simplicial complexes.

**Cohomology Theory**

**Cohomology Groups**:
Cohomology groups \( H^k(X) \) are defined using cochains, coboundaries, and cocycles. A \( k \)-cochain is a function from \( k \)-simplices to an abelian group. The coboundary operator maps \( k \)-cochains to \( (k+1) \)-cochains, and cocycles are cochains whose coboundary is zero. The \( k \)-th cohomology group is the quotient of cocycles by coboundaries.

**The De Rham Cohomology**:
De Rham cohomology involves differential forms on smooth manifolds. The exterior derivative \( d \) maps \( k \)-forms to \( (k+1) \)-forms. Two forms are cohomologous if their difference is an exact form. The \( k \)-th de Rham cohomology group is the space of closed \( k \)-forms modulo exact \( k \)-forms.

**Applications**:
De Rham cohomology provides a bridge between differential forms and topological properties of manifolds. For instance, the de Rham theorem states that de Rham cohomology is isomorphic to singular cohomology.

**Introduction to Differential Topology**

**Smooth Manifolds**:
A smooth manifold is a topological space that locally resembles Euclidean space and has a smooth structure. It is equipped with an atlas of charts, where transition maps between charts are smooth.

**Tangent Spaces and Vector Fields**:
At each point of a smooth manifold, the tangent space is a vector space that intuitively represents directions in which one can move from that point. A vector field is a smooth assignment of a tangent vector to each point of the manifold.

**Smooth Maps and Immersions**:
Smooth maps between manifolds preserve the smooth structure. An immersion is a smooth map whose differential is injective at every point. An embedding is an immersion that is also a homeomorphism onto its image.

**Implicit Function Theorem**:
The implicit function theorem provides conditions under which a system of equations implicitly defines a smooth function. If \( F(x, y) = 0 \) defines \( y \) as a smooth function of \( x \) locally, then \( F \) must have a non-zero Jacobian determinant with respect to \( y \).

**Differential Forms and Integration**:
Differential forms are generalizations of functions and can be integrated over manifolds. The exterior algebra is used to combine differential forms, and integration of \( k \)-forms over \( k \)-dimensional submanifolds extends the concept of integration.

**Stokes' Theorem**:
Stokes' theorem relates the integral of the exterior derivative of a differential form over a manifold to the integral of the form over its boundary. Formally:
\[ \int_M d\omega = \int_{\partial M} \omega \]

**Advanced Topics in General Topology**

**Compactness and Completeness**:
In metric spaces, compactness implies that every sequence has a convergent subsequence, and completeness means that every Cauchy sequence converges. General topological spaces may not have these properties, but they can still be analyzed for compactness in terms of open covers.

**Local and Global Properties**:
Local properties refer to characteristics that can be checked in a neighborhood of a point, like local compactness. Global properties are checked over the whole space, such as connectedness and compactness.

**Topological Groups**:
A topological group is a group with a topology such that the group operations (multiplication and inversion) are continuous. Examples include \( \mathbb{R}^n \) with addition and the circle \( S^1 \) with multiplication.

**Group Actions**:
A group action on a topological space \( X \

) is a map \( G \times X \to X \) satisfying certain axioms that make the group act on the space in a way that respects the group structure.

**Advanced Topics in Algebraic Topology**

**Homotopy Exact Sequences**:
Exact sequences are algebraic structures that capture how homotopy groups relate to one another in various contexts. The homotopy exact sequence is used to study the homotopy properties of pairs of spaces or fiber bundles.

**Morse Theory**:
Morse theory studies the topology of manifolds using smooth functions and their critical points. A Morse function is a smooth function with non-degenerate critical points, and the theory connects the number of critical points to the topology of the manifold.

**K-Theory**:
K-theory studies vector bundles and their classifications. The K-theory group \( K(X) \) of a space \( X \) is an algebraic invariant related to the classification of vector bundles over \( X \).

**Characteristic Classes**:
Characteristic classes are invariants that measure the failure of a vector bundle to be trivial. They provide a way to study the topology of vector bundles and relate to various topological and geometrical properties of manifolds.
