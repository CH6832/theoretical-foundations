### **1. Field Theory**

Field theory lays the groundwork for many advanced algebraic concepts. We'll explore field extensions, splitting fields, separable and inseparable extensions, and normal and Galois extensions.

#### **Field Extensions**

A **field extension** is a larger field containing a smaller field as a subfield. Let \( F \) be a field, and let \( K \) be a field such that \( F \subseteq K \). We call \( K \) an extension field of \( F \).

**Example 1: Degree of an Extension**
- **Simple Extension**: Consider \( \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}) \), the field obtained by adjoining \( \sqrt{2} \) to \( \mathbb{Q} \). Here, \( \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}) \) consists of all numbers of the form \( a + b\sqrt{2} \), where \( a, b \in \mathbb{Q} \).
- **Degree**: The degree of the extension \( [\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}) : \mathbb{Q}] \) is 2 because \( \{1, \sqrt{2}\} \) forms a basis for \( \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}) \) over \( \mathbb{Q} \).

**Proof Example: Tower Law**
- **Statement**: If \( F \subseteq K \subseteq L \) are fields, then the degree \( [L : F] = [L : K] \times [K : F] \).
- **Proof**: Let \( \{v_1, \dots, v_m\} \) be a basis of \( L \) over \( K \), and let \( \{w_1, \dots, w_n\} \) be a basis of \( K \) over \( F \). Then every element of \( L \) can be uniquely written as a linear combination of \( \{v_i w_j\} \), which proves the theorem.

**C++ Implementation: Field Extension Class**
- **Purpose**: Implement a class to represent and manipulate field extensions.
- **Code**:
  ```cpp
  class FieldExtension {
      private:
          std::vector<Polynomial> basis; // Store basis polynomials
      public:
          FieldExtension(std::vector<Polynomial> b) : basis(b) {}
          int calculateDegree() const { return basis.size(); }
          Polynomial minimalPolynomial(const Element& alpha) const;
          // Further methods to manipulate elements
  };
  ```

#### **Splitting Fields and Algebraic Closures**

A **splitting field** of a polynomial \( f(x) \) over \( F \) is the smallest field extension of \( F \) in which \( f(x) \) can be factored into linear factors.

**Example 2: Constructing a Splitting Field**
- **Problem**: Find the splitting field of \( x^3 - 2 \) over \( \mathbb{Q} \).
- **Solution**: The roots of \( x^3 - 2 \) are \( \sqrt[3]{2}, \sqrt[3]{2}\zeta_3, \sqrt[3]{2}\zeta_3^2 \), where \( \zeta_3 = e^{2\pi i / 3} \). The splitting field is \( \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[3]{2}, \zeta_3) \).

**Algebraic Closure**: An **algebraic closure** of a field \( F \) is an extension \( \overline{F} \) in which every polynomial in \( F[x] \) has a root. For example, \( \overline{\mathbb{Q}} \) is the algebraic closure of \( \mathbb{Q} \), containing all algebraic numbers.

**Exercise Example**: Prove that the splitting field of a polynomial is unique up to isomorphism.

#### **Separable and Inseparable Extensions**

A polynomial \( f(x) \) over \( F \) is **separable** if it has no repeated roots in its splitting field. Otherwise, it is **inseparable**.

**Example 3: Separable and Inseparable Polynomials**
- **Separable Polynomial**: The polynomial \( x^2 - 2 \) over \( \mathbb{Q} \) is separable because its roots \( \pm \sqrt{2} \) are distinct.
- **Inseparable Polynomial**: Consider \( x^p - a \) over \( \mathbb{F}_p \). This polynomial is inseparable if \( a \in \mathbb{F}_p \).

**Exercise Example**: Prove that a polynomial over a field of characteristic 0 is always separable.

#### **Normal and Galois Extensions**

A field extension \( K/F \) is **normal** if every irreducible polynomial over \( F \) that has a root in \( K \) splits completely in \( K \). When \( K/F \) is both normal and separable, it is called a **Galois extension**.

**Example 4: Galois Group of a Field**
- **Problem**: Determine the Galois group of \( x^4 - 2 \) over \( \mathbb{Q} \).
- **Solution**: The splitting field is \( \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[4]{2}, i) \). The Galois group is isomorphic to the Klein four-group \( V_4 \).

**Exercise Example**: Show that a field extension is Galois if and only if the Galois group acts transitively on the roots of every irreducible polynomial.

---

### **2. Galois Theory**

Galois theory provides a powerful connection between field theory and group theory, offering deep insights into the solvability of polynomials and the structure of fields.

#### **Galois Groups**

The **Galois group** of a field extension \( K/F \) is the group of all automorphisms of \( K \) that fix \( F \). This group encodes the symmetries of the roots of polynomials.

**Example 5: Galois Group Computation**
- **Problem**: Find the Galois group of \( x^3 - 2 \) over \( \mathbb{Q} \).
- **Solution**: The roots are \( \sqrt[3]{2}, \sqrt[3]{2}\zeta_3, \sqrt[3]{2}\zeta_3^2 \). The Galois group is isomorphic to \( \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \).

**C++ Implementation: Galois Group Class**
- **Purpose**: Develop a class to compute the Galois group of a given polynomial.
- **Code**:
  ```cpp
  class GaloisGroup {
      private:
          Polynomial poly; // The polynomial to study
      public:
          GaloisGroup(const Polynomial& p) : poly(p) {}
          std::vector<Automorphism> computeGroup();
          bool isSolvable();
  };
  ```

#### **The Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory**

The **Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory** establishes a correspondence between the subgroups of the Galois group \( \text{Gal}(K/F) \) and the intermediate fields between \( F \) and \( K \).

**Example 6: Subgroups and Intermediate Fields**
- **Problem**: For the extension \( \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[3]{2})/\mathbb{Q} \), identify the subgroups of the Galois group and their corresponding intermediate fields.
- **Solution**: The Galois group is \( \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \), and there are no nontrivial intermediate fields.

**Exercise Example**: Apply the fundamental theorem to solve the quintic equation \( x^5 - x + 1 = 0 \).

#### **Solvable Groups and Radical Extensions**

A polynomial is **solvable by radicals** if its roots can be expressed using a finite number of additions, subtractions, multiplications, divisions, and root extractions. The Galois group of a solvable polynomial is a **solvable group**.

**Example 7: Solvability of Polynomials**
- **Problem**: Determine whether the polynomial \( x^4 - 4x^2 + 2 \) is solvable by radicals.
- **Solution**: The Galois group is isomorphic to \( S_4 \), which is solvable. Thus, the polynomial is solvable by radicals.

**Exercise Example**: Prove that the general polynomial of degree 5 or higher is not solvable by radicals.

#### **Applications of Galois Theory**

Galois theory has profound implications in geometry and number theory

, particularly in problems like constructibility and the unsolvability of certain classical problems.

**Example 8: Impossibility of Angle Trisection**
- **Problem**: Use Galois theory to prove that trisecting an arbitrary angle using only a compass and straightedge is impossible.
- **Solution**: Show that the minimal polynomial of the angle is of degree 3, which is not solvable by radicals in general.

**Exercise Example**: Demonstrate the impossibility of doubling the cube using Galois theory.

### **3. Advanced Topics in Ring Theory**

In this section, we delve into Noetherian rings, Artinian rings, integral dependence, and Dedekind domains, all fundamental concepts in modern algebra.

#### **Noetherian Rings and Modules**

A ring \( R \) is **Noetherian** if every ascending chain of ideals terminates. This property is crucial in algebraic geometry and commutative algebra.

**Example 9: Hilbert’s Basis Theorem**
- **Statement**: If \( R \) is a Noetherian ring, then the polynomial ring \( R[x] \) is also Noetherian.
- **Proof**: Assume there is an ascending chain of ideals in \( R[x] \). The leading coefficients of these ideals form an ascending chain in \( R \), which must stabilize. Using this, one can show that the original chain stabilizes, proving the theorem.

**Exercise Example**: Prove that the ring of integers \( \mathbb{Z} \) is Noetherian.

#### **Artinian Rings and Modules**

A ring \( R \) is **Artinian** if every descending chain of ideals terminates. Artinian rings have a rich structure, especially in connection with representation theory.

**Example 10: Relationship Between Noetherian and Artinian Rings**
- **Statement**: Every Artinian ring is Noetherian, but the converse is not true.
- **Proof**: Use the descending chain condition on ideals to show that the ring satisfies the ascending chain condition, hence Noetherian.

**Exercise Example**: Explore examples of rings that are Noetherian but not Artinian.

#### **Integral Dependence and the Lasker–Noether Theorem**

An element \( x \) is **integral** over a ring \( R \) if it satisfies a monic polynomial with coefficients in \( R \). The **Lasker–Noether Theorem** deals with the primary decomposition of ideals in Noetherian rings.

**Example 11: Integral Dependence**
- **Problem**: Show that any element in a field extension \( K/F \) that is algebraic over \( F \) is integral over \( F \).
- **Solution**: If \( \alpha \in K \) is algebraic over \( F \), it satisfies a polynomial \( f(x) \in F[x] \). Since \( f(x) \) is monic, \( \alpha \) is integral over \( F \).

**Exercise Example**: Prove the Lasker–Noether theorem and apply it to the ring \( \mathbb{Z}[x] \).

#### **Dedekind Domains**

A **Dedekind domain** is an integral domain in which every non-zero ideal factors uniquely into prime ideals. These domains are essential in algebraic number theory.

**Example 12: Dedekind Domain and Unique Factorization**
- **Problem**: Prove that the ring of integers \( \mathcal{O}_K \) in a number field \( K \) is a Dedekind domain.
- **Solution**: Show that \( \mathcal{O}_K \) satisfies the properties of integrality, Noetherianness, and unique factorization of ideals.

**Exercise Example**: Explore the factorization of ideals in \( \mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-5}] \), which is not a Dedekind domain.

---

### **4. Modules and Representation Theory**

Modules provide a generalization of vector spaces, while representation theory connects group theory with linear algebra, allowing us to study group actions through matrices.

#### **Structure Theorem for Modules over a PID**

The **Structure Theorem** states that any finitely generated module over a PID can be expressed as a direct sum of cyclic modules.

**Example 13: Classification of Abelian Groups**
- **Problem**: Classify all abelian groups of order 60.
- **Solution**: The abelian groups are \( \mathbb{Z}/60\mathbb{Z} \), \( \mathbb{Z}/30\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z} \), \( \mathbb{Z}/15\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}/4\mathbb{Z} \), and \( \mathbb{Z}/10\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}/6\mathbb{Z} \).

**Exercise Example**: Use the structure theorem to classify finitely generated modules over \( \mathbb{Z} \).

#### **Introduction to Representation Theory of Finite Groups**

A **representation** of a group \( G \) is a homomorphism from \( G \) to \( GL(V) \), the group of invertible linear transformations on a vector space \( V \).

**Example 14: Representation of the Symmetric Group \( S_3 \)**
- **Problem**: Construct a 2-dimensional representation of \( S_3 \).
- **Solution**: Define the action of \( S_3 \) on \( \mathbb{R}^2 \) by permuting the basis vectors. This representation can be studied through the associated character table.

**Exercise Example**: Compute the character table of \( S_3 \) and interpret its entries.

#### **Maschke’s Theorem and Complete Reducibility**

**Maschke’s Theorem** states that every representation of a finite group over a field of characteristic not dividing the group order is completely reducible.

**Example 15: Application of Maschke’s Theorem**
- **Problem**: Show that any representation of \( S_3 \) over \( \mathbb{C} \) is completely reducible.
- **Solution**: Since the characteristic of \( \mathbb{C} \) does not divide the order of \( S_3 \), apply Maschke’s theorem to conclude that every \( S_3 \)-module decomposes into irreducible components.

**Exercise Example**: Apply Maschke’s theorem to classify the irreducible representations of \( \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z} \).

### **5. Advanced Topics in Field Theory (if time permits)**

This section covers specialized topics, such as transcendental extensions, infinite Galois theory, and cyclotomic fields.

#### **Transcendental Extensions**

A **transcendental extension** occurs when some elements of the extension field are not roots of any polynomial with coefficients in the base field.

**Example 16: Transcendence Degree**
- **Problem**: Determine the transcendence degree of \( \mathbb{C}(x, y) \) over \( \mathbb{C} \).
- **Solution**: The transcendence degree is 2, as \( \{x, y\} \) are algebraically independent over \( \mathbb{C} \).

**Exercise Example**: Explore the transcendence degree of function fields in algebraic geometry.

#### **Infinite Galois Theory**

**Infinite Galois theory** extends finite Galois theory to infinite field extensions, utilizing profinite groups and the Krull topology.

**Example 17: Krull Topology**
- **Problem**: Describe the Krull topology on the Galois group of the algebraic closure of \( \mathbb{Q} \) over \( \mathbb{Q} \).
- **Solution**: The Galois group is profinite, with the Krull topology defined by the inverse limit of finite Galois groups.

**Exercise Example**: Analyze the Galois group of \( \overline{\mathbb{Q}}/\mathbb{Q} \) and its topological properties.

#### **Cyclotomic Fields and Kummer Theory**

**Cyclotomic fields** are generated by roots of unity, with Galois groups that are abelian. **Kummer theory** generalizes this to extensions obtained by adjoining roots of elements.

**Example 18: Cyclotomic Field**
- **Problem**: Compute the Galois group of the cyclotomic field \( \mathbb{Q}(\zeta_5) \) over \( \mathbb{Q} \).
- **Solution**: The Galois group is isomorphic to \( \mathbb{Z}/4\mathbb{Z} \).

**Exercise Example**: Use Kummer theory to solve classical problems in number theory, such as Fermat’s Last Theorem for specific exponents.
