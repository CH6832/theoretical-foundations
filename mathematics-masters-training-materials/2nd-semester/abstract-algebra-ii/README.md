### **Assessment Methods**
- **Problem Sets**: Weekly assignments that involve rigorous proof-based problems, calculations, and applications of advanced algebraic concepts.
- **Midterm Exam**: A comprehensive exam covering the first half of the course, focusing on field theory and Galois theory.
- **Final Exam/Project**: A final exam or a project that could involve deeper exploration of a specific topic, such as advanced applications of Galois theory, in-depth study of a particular algebraic structure, or research into open problems in algebra.

### **Textbooks and References**
- **"Algebra" by Serge Lang**: A comprehensive text that covers both foundational and advanced topics in algebra, including field theory and Galois theory.
- **"Abstract Algebra" by David S. Dummit and Richard M. Foote**: A detailed text with a strong emphasis on examples, problems, and applications, especially useful for studying Galois theory.
- **"Fields and Galois Theory" by John M. Howie**: A focused text that provides a clear and concise introduction to field theory and Galois theory, suitable for graduate-level studies.
- **"Algebra" by Thomas W. Hungerford**: Another standard graduate text that provides thorough coverage of the topics in both parts of an advanced algebra sequence.

This course, "Advanced Algebra II," would typically be followed by more specialized courses in algebra, such as commutative algebra, advanced representation theory, or algebraic geometry, depending on the student's interests and the program's offerings.
