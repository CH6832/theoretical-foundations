# Quantum Mechanics I

## Course Description

This course introduces the foundational principles of quantum mechanics, focusing on the mathematical framework and physical concepts essential for understanding the behavior of quantum systems. The course covers the basics of quantum theory, including wave-particle duality, the Schrödinger equation, and fundamental quantum phenomena.

## Key Topics

### Fundamental Concepts
- **Wave-Particle Duality:**
  - **De Broglie Hypothesis:** The concept of matter waves and their implications.
  - **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle:** The limits on the precision of simultaneously measuring position and momentum.
- **Quantum Superposition and Entanglement:**
  - **Superposition Principle:** The idea that a quantum system can exist in multiple states simultaneously.
  - **Quantum Entanglement:** The phenomenon where particles become interconnected such that the state of one particle instantly influences the state of another, regardless of distance.

### Schrödinger Equation
- **Time-Dependent Schrödinger Equation:**
  - **Formulation:** Understanding the evolution of quantum systems over time.
  - **Applications:** Solutions for simple systems such as the particle in a box and the harmonic oscillator.
- **Time-Independent Schrödinger Equation:**
  - **Stationary States:** Solutions that describe the energy levels and wavefunctions of quantum systems.

### Quantum Mechanics Formalism
- **Operators and Observables:**
  - **Quantum Operators:** The mathematical operators corresponding to physical observables.
  - **Eigenvalues and Eigenfunctions:** The possible outcomes of measurements and the corresponding quantum states.
- **Wavefunctions and Probability:**
  - **Normalization and Probability Density:** The concept of probability density functions in quantum mechanics.
  - **Expectation Values:** Calculating the average value of an observable in a given quantum state.
