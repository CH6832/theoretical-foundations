# Classical Electrodynamics

## Course Description

This course covers the fundamental principles of classical electrodynamics, focusing on Maxwell's equations and their applications to various physical systems. The course explores the behavior of electric and magnetic fields, electromagnetic waves, and their interactions with matter. Students will develop a deep understanding of the classical theory of electromagnetism and its significance in modern physics.
