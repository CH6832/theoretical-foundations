### Classical Electrodynamics: Comprehensive Overview

Classical electrodynamics is a cornerstone of physics that deals with the behavior of electric and magnetic fields, their interactions with matter, and the propagation of electromagnetic waves. This course explores the classical theory of electromagnetism through Maxwell's equations and their applications. Below is a detailed outline of the key topics in classical electrodynamics.

## Key Topics

### Maxwell's Equations

#### **Electrostatics**

- **Gauss's Law:**
  - **Concept:** Gauss's Law relates the electric flux through a closed surface to the charge enclosed by that surface. It is mathematically expressed as:
    
    $\oint_{\partial V} \mathbf{E} \cdot d\mathbf{A} = \frac{Q_{\text{enc}}}{\epsilon_0}$
    
    where $( \mathbf{E} )$ is the electric field, $( d\mathbf{A} )$ is the differential area vector on the closed surface, $( Q_{\text{enc}} )$ is the total charge enclosed, and $( \epsilon_0 )$ is the permittivity of free space.

- **Electric Potential:**
  - **Concept:** The electric potential $( V )$ at a point in space is defined as the work done per unit charge to move a test charge from infinity to that point. The relation between electric field $( \mathbf{E} )$ and electric potential is:
    $\mathbf{E} = -\nabla V$
    where $( \nabla V )$ is the gradient of the electric potential.

#### **Magnetostatics**

- **Ampère's Law:**
  - **Concept:** Ampère's Law relates the magnetic field $( \mathbf{B} )$ around a closed loop to the current passing through the loop. It is given by:
    $\oint_{\partial S} \mathbf{B} \cdot d\mathbf{l} = \mu_0 I_{\text{enc}}$
    where $( d\mathbf{l} )$ is the differential length vector around the loop, $( I_{\text{enc}} )$ is the current enclosed by the loop, and $( \mu_0 )$ is the permeability of free space.

- **Magnetic Vector Potential:**
  - **Concept:** The magnetic vector potential $( \mathbf{A} )$ is defined such that:
    $\mathbf{B} = \nabla \times \mathbf{A}$
    The magnetic vector potential is useful for solving problems in magnetostatics and electromagnetism, particularly in complex geometries.

#### **Time-Varying Fields**

- **Faraday's Law of Induction:**
  - **Concept:** Faraday's Law states that a changing magnetic field induces an electric field. It is mathematically expressed as:
    $\oint_{\partial S} \mathbf{E} \cdot d\mathbf{l} = -\frac{d\Phi_B}{dt}$
    where $( \Phi_B )$ is the magnetic flux through the surface $( S )$ bounded by the loop $( \partial S )$.

- **Maxwell's Equations in Free Space:**
  - **Concept:** Maxwell's equations in free space are the set of four fundamental equations that describe the behavior of electric and magnetic fields. In free space, they are:
    $\begin{aligned}
    \nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} &= 0, \\
    \nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} &= 0, \\
    \nabla \times \mathbf{E} &= -\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t}, \\
    \nabla \times \mathbf{B} &= \mu_0 \epsilon_0 \frac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t}.
    \end{aligned}$

### Electromagnetic Waves

#### **Wave Equations**

- **Plane Waves:**
  - **Concept:** Plane waves are solutions to Maxwell's equations that describe uniform wave propagation. The electric and magnetic fields in a plane wave can be written as:
    $\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{r}, t) = \mathbf{E}_0 e^{i(\mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{r} - \omega t)}$
    $\mathbf{B}(\mathbf{r}, t) = \mathbf{B}_0 e^{i(\mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{r} - \omega t)}$
    where $( \mathbf{E}_0 )$ and $( \mathbf{B}_0 )$ are the amplitudes of the electric and magnetic fields, $( \mathbf{k} )$ is the wave vector, and $( \omega )$ is the angular frequency.

- **Polarization and Reflection:**
  - **Concept:** Polarization describes the orientation of the electric field in a light wave. Reflection involves the change in direction of a wave when it encounters a boundary. The reflection and transmission coefficients can be calculated using boundary conditions and Snell's Law.

#### **Wave Propagation in Media**

- **Dielectrics and Conductors:**
  - **Concept:** Electromagnetic wave propagation in dielectric materials is governed by the material’s permittivity $( \epsilon )$ and permeability $( \mu )$. For conductors, the conductivity $( \sigma )$ affects wave attenuation.
  - **Example:**
    The wave equation in a dielectric medium is:
    $\nabla^2 \mathbf{E} - \frac{1}{c^2} \frac{\partial^2 \mathbf{E}}{\partial t^2} = 0$
    where $( c )$ is the speed of light in the medium.

- **Dispersion Relations:**
  - **Concept:** Dispersion relations describe how wave speed varies with frequency. In a medium, the dispersion relation is:
    $\omega^2 = c^2 k^2$
    where $( \omega )$ is the angular frequency and $( k )$ is the wave number.

### Radiation

#### **Electromagnetic Radiation**

- **Dipole Radiation:**
  - **Concept:** The radiation pattern of an oscillating electric dipole can be described by:
    $\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{r}, t) = \frac{p_0 \sin \theta}{4 \pi \epsilon_0 c r} e^{i(kr - \omega t)}$
    where $( p_0 )$ is the dipole moment, $( \theta )$ is the angle from the dipole axis, $( r )$ is the distance from the dipole, and $( c )$ is the speed of light.

- **Larmor Formula:**
  - **Concept:** The Larmor formula gives the power radiated by a non-relativistic accelerating charge:
    $P = \frac{e^2 a^2}{6 \pi \epsilon_0 c^3}$
    where $( e )$ is the charge, $( a )$ is the acceleration, and $( c )$ is the speed of light.

#### **Radiation in Relativistic Contexts**

- **Synchrotron Radiation:**
  - **Concept:** Synchrotron radiation is emitted by charged particles moving at relativistic speeds in magnetic fields. The power radiated by a relativistic electron is given by:
    $P = \frac{e^2 \gamma^4}{6 \pi \epsilon_0 c} \left( \frac{v \times B}{c} \right)^2$
    where $( \gamma )$ is the Lorentz factor, $( v )$ is the particle velocity, and $( B )$ is the magnetic field.
