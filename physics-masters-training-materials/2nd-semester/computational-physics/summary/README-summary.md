## Topics Covered

### Numerical Methods

#### **Numerical Integration and Differentiation**

- **Techniques for Approximating Integrals and Derivatives:**
  - **Trapezoidal Rule:** Approximates the integral of a function by dividing the area under the curve into trapezoids.
    \[
    I \approx \frac{h}{2} \left[ f(x_0) + 2 \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} f(x_i) + f(x_n) \right]
    \]
    where \( h \) is the step size and \( x_i \) are the points in the interval.
  - **Simpson's Rule:** Provides a better approximation by using quadratic polynomials to estimate the integral.
    \[
    I \approx \frac{h}{3} \left[ f(x_0) + 4 \sum_{\text{odd } i} f(x_i) + 2 \sum_{\text{even } i \neq 0, n} f(x_i) + f(x_n) \right]
    \]
  - **Finite Difference Methods:** Used for numerical differentiation by approximating derivatives with finite differences.
    \[
    \frac{d f(x)}{d x} \approx \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}
    \]
    where \( h \) is a small step size.

#### **Solution of Ordinary and Partial Differential Equations**

- **Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs):**
  - **Euler's Method:** A simple method for solving ODEs by using the forward difference approximation.
    \[
    y_{n+1} = y_n + h f(t_n, y_n)
    \]
    where \( h \) is the step size and \( f(t, y) \) is the function defining the ODE.
  - **Runge-Kutta Methods:** More accurate methods for solving ODEs, with the fourth-order Runge-Kutta being widely used.
    \[
    k_1 = h f(t_n, y_n)
    \]
    \[
    k_2 = h f(t_n + \frac{h}{2}, y_n + \frac{k_1}{2})
    \]
    \[
    k_3 = h f(t_n + \frac{h}{2}, y_n + \frac{k_2}{2})
    \]
    \[
    k_4 = h f(t_n + h, y_n + k_3)
    \]
    \[
    y_{n+1} = y_n + \frac{1}{6}(k_1 + 2k_2 + 2k_3 + k_4)
    \]

- **Partial Differential Equations (PDEs):**
  - **Finite Difference Methods:** Used for solving PDEs by discretizing the spatial and temporal domains.
    \[
    \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = \alpha \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}
    \]
    where \( \alpha \) is the diffusion coefficient. Discretize using:
    \[
    \frac{u_{i}^{n+1} - u_{i}^n}{\Delta t} = \alpha \frac{u_{i+1}^n - 2u_i^n + u_{i-1}^n}{(\Delta x)^2}
    \]
  - **Finite Element Methods (FEM):** A technique for solving PDEs by breaking down the problem domain into smaller, simpler parts called elements and using variational methods to approximate solutions.

### Monte Carlo Methods

#### **Basics of Monte Carlo Simulations**

- **Introduction to Random Number Generation:**
  - **Random Number Generators (RNGs):** Algorithms for generating sequences of numbers that approximate the properties of random sequences. Common RNGs include linear congruential generators and Mersenne Twister.

- **Monte Carlo Integration and Sampling:**
  - **Monte Carlo Integration:** Uses random sampling to estimate the value of integrals.
    \[
    I \approx \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} f(x_i)
    \]
    where \( x_i \) are randomly sampled points in the domain.
  - **Monte Carlo Sampling:** Generates random samples from a distribution to estimate properties such as mean and variance.

  - **Signal Processing:** FFT is used to transform time-domain signals into frequency-domain representations.
    \[
    X(k) = \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x(n) e^{-i 2 \pi k n / N}
    \]
  - **Data Analysis:** FFT helps in analyzing periodic components of data and filtering signals.
