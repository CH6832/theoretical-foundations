# Elective IV: Advanced Risk Management

## Course Overview

This course provides an in-depth exploration of advanced topics in risk management, focusing on methodologies, tools, and practices used to identify, assess, and mitigate risks within financial institutions. The course will cover enterprise risk management (ERM), stress testing, liquidity risk management, and operational risk.

## Topics Covered

### Enterprise Risk Management (ERM)

**Integrated Risk Management:**

**Overview of ERM Frameworks and Principles:**
- Define ERM frameworks to provide a comprehensive approach for identifying, assessing, managing, and monitoring risks.
- Identify key frameworks such as COSO and ISO 31000.

**Mathematical Formulation (Risk Assessment):**
- Define VaR as the maximum loss not exceeded with a certain confidence level.
- Formula: VaR_alpha = -Quantile_alpha(Loss Distribution)

**Example: Calculating VaR**
BEGIN
    # Simulated loss data
    losses = generate_normal_distribution(mean=0, std_dev=1, size=1000)

    # Calculate VaR at 95% confidence level
    var_95 = percentile(losses, 5)
    output("VaR at 95% confidence level: " + var_95)
END

**Risk Culture:**

**Understanding and Developing a Strong Risk Culture:**
- Define risk culture as shared values, beliefs, and practices influencing risk perception and management.

**Methods for Assessing and Enhancing Risk Culture:**
- Conduct assessments through surveys, interviews, and audits. Measure metrics like risk awareness scores and incident reporting rates.

**Example: Survey Analysis**
BEGIN
    # Example survey data
    data = create_data_frame(Risk_Awareness_Score=[5, 4, 3, 2, 5, 4, 3, 4, 5], 
                             Incident_Reporting_Rate=[1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1])

    # Calculate average risk awareness score
    average_score = mean(data['Risk_Awareness_Score'])
    output("Average Risk Awareness Score: " + average_score)
END

**Risk Appetite:**

**Defining and Setting Risk Appetite and Tolerance Levels:**
- Define risk appetite as the amount of risk an organization is willing to take.
- Define risk tolerance as the acceptable level of variation around risk targets.

**Mathematical Formulation (Risk Appetite):**
- Define CAR as Capital / Risk-Weighted Assets.

**Example: Calculating CAR**
BEGIN
    # Example capital and risk-weighted assets
    capital = 1000000
    risk_weighted_assets = 5000000

    # Calculate CAR
    car = capital / risk_weighted_assets
    output("Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR): " + car)
END

### Stress Testing and Scenario Analysis

**Regulatory Stress Tests:**

**Overview of Regulatory Requirements:**
- Define stress testing regulations like CCAR and DFAST that evaluate impacts of adverse scenarios on capital.

**Mathematical Formulation (Stress Testing):**
- Define stress tests involving simulating scenarios with adverse conditions.
- Formula: Stress Test Metric = Baseline Metric * (1 - Stress Factor)

**Example: Stress Testing**
BEGIN
    # Example baseline capital
    baseline_capital = 1000000

    # Stress factor (e.g., a 20% decrease)
    stress_factor = 0.20

    # Calculate stressed capital
    stressed_capital = baseline_capital * (1 - stress_factor)
    output("Stressed Capital: " + stressed_capital)
END

**Scenario Design:**

**Creating Realistic and Relevant Stress Scenarios:**
- Design scenarios reflecting adverse conditions affecting financial stability.

**Example: Scenario Analysis**
BEGIN
    # Example portfolio returns
    portfolio_returns = generate_normal_distribution(mean=0.01, std_dev=0.02, size=1000)

    # Scenario: Market crash with a -30% return
    market_crash_return = -0.30
    crashed_portfolio = portfolio_returns * (1 + market_crash_return)
    output("Portfolio Return After Market Crash: " + mean(crashed_portfolio))
END

**Reverse Stress Testing:**

**Techniques for Reverse Stress Testing:**
- Identify scenarios causing severe financial distress to develop contingency plans.

**Example: Reverse Stress Testing**
BEGIN
    # Example stress test results
    capital = 1000000
    losses = generate_normal_distribution(mean=0, std_dev=1, size=1000)
    reverse_stress_threshold = percentile(losses, 95)

    # Calculate potential impact
    potential_impact = capital * reverse_stress_threshold
    output("Potential Impact Under Extreme Conditions: " + potential_impact)
END

### Liquidity Risk Management

**Liquidity Stress Testing:**

**Methods for Assessing Liquidity Risk:**
- Conduct liquidity stress tests to evaluate the ability to meet short-term obligations.

**Mathematical Formulation (Liquidity Coverage Ratio - LCR):**
- Define LCR as HQLA / Net Cash Outflows.

**Example: Calculating LCR**
BEGIN
    # Example HQLA and net cash outflows
    hqlas = 500000
    net_cash_outflows = 300000

    # Calculate LCR
    lcr = hqlas / net_cash_outflows
    output("Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR): " + lcr)
END

**Funding Liquidity:**

**Principles of Funding Liquidity:**
- Define funding liquidity as the ability to meet liabilities without incurring unacceptable losses.

**Mathematical Formulation (Net Stable Funding Ratio - NSFR):**
- Define NSFR as Available Stable Funding / Required Stable Funding.

**Example: Calculating NSFR**
BEGIN
    # Example available and required stable funding
    available_stable_funding = 800000
    required_stable_funding = 600000

    # Calculate NSFR
    nsfr = available_stable_funding / required_stable_funding
    output("Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR): " + nsfr)
END

**Market Liquidity:**

**Assessing and Managing Market Liquidity Risk:**
- Measure the risk of not being able to buy or sell assets without significantly affecting their price.

**Example: Market Liquidity Risk**
BEGIN
    # Example market depth data
    market_depth = create_array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) 

    # Measure liquidity risk
    average_liquidity = mean(market_depth)
    output("Average Market Liquidity: " + average_liquidity)
END

### Operational Risk

**Risk Identification:**

**Methods for Identifying Operational Risks:**
- Identify operational risks through risk assessments, audits, and incident reporting.

**Example: Risk Identification**
BEGIN
    # Example risk events
    events = create_data_frame(Event_Type=['Fraud', 'System Failure', 'Compliance Breach'], 
                               Frequency=[10, 5, 3])

    # Calculate risk frequency
    risk_frequency = sum(events['Frequency'])
    output("Total Risk Frequency: " + risk_frequency)
END

**Risk Assessment:**

**Techniques for Assessing Operational Risks:**
- Evaluate likelihood and impact of identified risks using quantitative and qualitative methods.

**Mathematical Formulation (Risk Score):**
- Define Risk Score = Probability * Impact.

**Python Example: Risk Score Calculation**
BEGIN
    # Example risk probabilities and impacts
    probabilities = create_array([0.1, 0.2, 0.05])
    impacts = create_array([10000, 20000, 15000])

    # Calculate risk scores
    risk_scores = probabilities * impacts
    total_risk_score = sum(risk_scores)
    output("Total Risk Score: " + total_risk_score)
END

**Control Frameworks:**

**Developing and Implementing Control Frameworks:**
- Design controls to mitigate operational risks, including monitoring and testing effectiveness.

**Example: Control Effectiveness**
BEGIN
    # Example control effectiveness data
    controls = create_data_frame(Control_Name=['Control A', 'Control B'], 
                                 Effectiveness=[0.9, 0.8]) 

    # Calculate average control effectiveness
    average_effectiveness = mean(controls['Effectiveness'])
    output("Average Control Effectiveness: " + average_effectiveness)
END

**Loss Data Collection:**

**Methods for Collecting and Analyzing Loss Data:**
- Track and analyze operational losses to improve risk management practices.

**Example: Loss Data Analysis**
BEGIN
    # Example loss data
    loss_data = create_array([1000, 2000, 1500, 3000, 500])

    # Calculate average loss
    average_loss = mean(loss_data)
    output("Average Operational Loss: " + average_loss)
