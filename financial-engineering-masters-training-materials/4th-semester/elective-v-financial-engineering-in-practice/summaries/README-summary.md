# Elective V: Financial Engineering in Practice

## Course Overview

This course focuses on the practical aspects of financial engineering, exploring real-world applications, innovative financial products, and ethical considerations. The course combines theoretical knowledge with hands-on case studies, structured products, and emerging technologies in finance.

## Topics Covered

### Case Studies in Financial Engineering

**Real-World Applications:**

**Analysis of Successful and Unsuccessful Financial Engineering Projects:**
- Case studies highlight both successful implementations and notable failures in financial engineering. For instance, Apple’s successful issuance of convertible bonds can be contrasted with the failures associated with complex mortgage-backed securities (MBS) during the 2008 financial crisis.

**Mathematical Formulation: Performance Metrics**
- **Sharpe Ratio:** This ratio measures the risk-adjusted return of an investment and is defined as:

\[
\text{Sharpe Ratio} = \frac{R_p - R_f}{\sigma_p}
\]

where \( R_p \) is the portfolio return, \( R_f \) is the risk-free rate, and \( \sigma_p \) is the standard deviation of the portfolio returns. The Sharpe Ratio helps assess whether the returns of a portfolio are due to smart investment decisions or excessive risk-taking.

**Pseudocode Example: Calculating Sharpe Ratio**

```
1. Generate synthetic portfolio returns using a normal distribution with a mean of 0.01 and standard deviation of 0.02
2. Set the risk-free rate to 0.002
3. Calculate excess returns by subtracting the risk-free rate from portfolio returns
4. Calculate Sharpe Ratio as the mean of excess returns divided by the standard deviation of excess returns
5. Print Sharpe Ratio
```

**Successes and Failures:**

**In-depth Examination of Notable Successes and Failures:**
- Successful projects such as the Black-Scholes model for option pricing illustrate effective financial engineering. Conversely, failures like the Lehman Brothers’ CDOs underscore the risks involved in complex financial products.

**Mathematical Formulation: Risk Assessment**
- **Return on Investment (ROI):**

\[
\text{ROI} = \frac{\text{Final Value} - \text{Initial Investment}}{\text{Initial Investment}}
\]

- **Standard Deviation (σ):** Measures the dispersion of returns. For returns \( r_i \) with mean \( \bar{r} \):

\[
\sigma = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (r_i - \bar{r})^2}{n-1}}
\]

**Pseudocode Example: Risk Assessment**

```
1. Generate example monthly returns using a normal distribution with a mean of 0.05 and standard deviation of 0.1
2. Set the initial investment to 1000
3. Calculate final value as initial investment multiplied by (1 + mean of returns)
4. Calculate ROI as (final value - initial investment) / initial investment
5. Calculate standard deviation of returns
6. Print ROI and standard deviation of returns
7. Create a histogram of returns distribution
```

### Structured Products

**Construction and Pricing:**

**Methods for Constructing Structured Products:**
- Structured products combine multiple financial instruments into a single product. Common examples include structured notes and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). The pricing of these products often involves complex models to account for various risk factors.

**Mathematical Formulation: Pricing Structured Products**
- **Binomial Model:** Used for pricing options and structured products by simulating multiple paths of asset prices.

\[
V = \frac{1}{(1 + r)^T} \sum_{i=1}^{n} p_i \times \text{Payoff}_i
\]

where \( p_i \) represents the risk-neutral probability of state \( i \), \( \text{Payoff}_i \) is the payoff in state \( i \), and \( r \) is the risk-free rate.

**Pseudocode Example: Pricing a Simple Structured Note**

```
1. Define cash flows as an array [100, 100, 100, 100, 105]
2. Set discount rate to 0.03
3. Calculate present value of cash flows by summing cash flows divided by (1 + discount rate) raised to the power of time
4. Print present value of structured note
```

**Risk-Return Profiles:**

**Analysis of Risk-Return Profiles:**
- Structured products have varying risk-return profiles. For instance, equity-linked notes typically offer higher returns but come with higher risk compared to bonds.

**Mathematical Formulation:**
- **Risk and Return Analysis:**

\[
\text{Expected Return} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} p_i \times r_i
\]

where \( p_i \) is the probability of return \( r_i \).

- **Standard Deviation (σ):**

\[
\sigma = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n} p_i \times (r_i - \text{Expected Return})^2}
\]

**Pseudocode Example: Calculating ROI and Standard Deviation**

```
1. Set initial investment to 1000 and final value to 1200
2. Generate example monthly returns using a normal distribution with a mean of 0.05 and standard deviation of 0.1
3. Calculate ROI as (final value - initial investment) / initial investment
4. Calculate standard deviation of returns
5. Print ROI and standard deviation of returns
```

**Regulatory Considerations:**

**Overview of Regulatory Frameworks:**
- Structured products are regulated under frameworks like Basel III and Dodd-Frank. These regulations mandate transparency and risk disclosure to prevent systemic risk and protect investors.

**Pseudocode Example: Regulatory Compliance Check**

```
1. Create a data frame with structured products and their risk disclosure statuses
2. Check compliance by filtering for complete risk disclosures
3. Print compliance status of structured products
```
