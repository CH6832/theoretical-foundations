## Course Descriptions

### Semester 1

#### Foundations of Finance
This introductory course provides a solid grounding in key financial concepts and principles. Topics include financial markets, instruments, and the time value of money, setting the stage for advanced studies in financial engineering.

#### Numerical Methods for Financial Engineering
This course covers essential numerical techniques for solving complex financial problems. Topics include root-finding methods, optimization techniques, Monte Carlo simulation, and finite difference methods. Students will apply these methods to price derivatives and manage portfolios.

#### Quantitative Methods in Finance
Students will explore statistical methods and their applications in finance. Key topics include regression analysis, hypothesis testing, time series analysis, and data mining. Emphasis will be placed on using quantitative techniques to inform financial decision-making.

#### Stochastic Calculus and Financial Derivatives
This course introduces stochastic processes and their applications in financial modeling. Students will learn about Brownian motion, Ito's lemma, and the Black-Scholes model, emphasizing the valuation of financial derivatives using stochastic calculus.

### Semester 2

#### Advanced Derivatives and Risk Management
This course focuses on exotic options and advanced derivatives, covering pricing models, volatility surfaces, and risk management techniques. Students will learn how to manage and hedge risks associated with complex financial instruments.

#### Financial Econometrics
This course applies econometric techniques to financial data analysis. Topics include asset pricing models, volatility modeling, and testing for market efficiency. Students will gain hands-on experience using statistical software for financial data analysis.

#### Fixed Income Securities
This course provides an in-depth study of fixed income instruments, covering bond pricing, yield curves, interest rate risk, and credit risk. Students will analyze various fixed income products, including government bonds, corporate bonds, and mortgage-backed securities.

### Semester 3

#### Machine Learning in Finance
This course introduces machine learning techniques and their applications in finance. Topics include supervised and unsupervised learning, neural networks, and algorithmic trading. Students will work on projects that apply machine learning to real-world financial problems.

#### Computational Finance
Focusing on computational methods in finance, this course covers topics such as numerical optimization, algorithmic trading strategies, and high-frequency trading. Students will develop skills to implement and analyze computational algorithms in financial contexts.

#### Advanced Portfolio Management
This course explores modern portfolio theory, asset allocation, and performance evaluation. Students will learn to construct and manage optimal portfolios using quantitative techniques and risk management strategies.

### Semester 4

#### Advanced Risk Management
In this course, students will study the principles of risk management within financial institutions. Topics include market risk, credit risk, operational risk, and regulatory frameworks. The course will emphasize developing risk management models and strategies.

#### Financial Engineering in Practice
This course applies the theoretical knowledge gained throughout the program to practical situations in the financial industry. Students will work on real-world case studies and projects, gaining insights into the practical challenges and solutions in financial engineering.

#### Advanced Topics in Financial Engineering
This course explores cutting-edge topics in financial engineering, such as blockchain technology, algorithmic trading, and the impact of artificial intelligence on finance. Students will engage in discussions and projects that reflect the latest trends and innovations in the field.

#### Capstone Project
In the final semester, students will undertake a capstone project that integrates knowledge from the entire program. Students will work individually or in teams to research a financial engineering problem, develop a quantitative solution, and present their findings.
