# Elective III: Advanced Portfolio Management

## Course Overview
This course provides an in-depth exploration of advanced strategies and theories in portfolio management. Students will delve into modern portfolio theory, alternative investments, behavioral finance, and dynamic portfolio strategies. The primary goal is to equip students with the necessary skills to effectively manage portfolios, optimize returns, and control risks through quantitative techniques and an understanding of market behavior.

## Topics Covered

### **Mean-Variance Optimization**

#### **Efficient Frontier**

**Introduction to the Efficient Frontier:**
- The efficient frontier is a graphical representation of the optimal portfolios that provide the highest expected return for a given level of risk or the lowest risk for a given expected return. It is rooted in the mean-variance optimization framework created by Harry Markowitz.

**Mathematical Formulation:**
- Let:
  - \( w \): vector of portfolio weights
  - \( \mu \): vector of expected returns
  - \( \Sigma \): covariance matrix of asset returns

The expected return and variance of the portfolio are expressed as:
- Expected Return: 
  \[
  \mathbb{E}[R_p] = w^T \mu
  \]
- Variance: 
  \[
  \sigma_p^2 = w^T \Sigma w
  \]

**Constructing the Efficient Frontier:**
- To derive the efficient frontier, solve the optimization problem for various levels of expected return:
\[
\min_w \, w^T \Sigma w
\]
subject to:
\[
\mathbb{E}[R_p] = w^T \mu, \quad \sum_{i=1}^n w_i = 1, \quad w_i \geq 0 \text{ for all } i
\]

**Pseudocode for Efficient Frontier Construction:**
```plaintext
1. Define expected returns vector (mu) and covariance matrix (Sigma)
2. Initialize number of portfolios (num_portfolios)
3. Create empty array to store results
4. For each portfolio in range(num_portfolios):
    a. Randomly generate weights for the assets
    b. Normalize weights (sum to 1)
    c. Calculate portfolio return using expected returns
    d. Calculate portfolio standard deviation using covariance matrix
    e. Store the return and standard deviation
5. Plot return vs. standard deviation
```

**Practical Application: Identifying Optimal Portfolios**
- Portfolios are typically selected based on the highest Sharpe ratio, which is defined as:
\[
\text{Sharpe} = \frac{\mathbb{E}[R_p] - R_f}{\sigma_p}
\]
Where \( R_f \) is the risk-free rate. The portfolio with the highest Sharpe ratio is often found at the tangent point between the efficient frontier and the Capital Market Line (CML).

#### **Markowitz Model**

**In-Depth Study of the Markowitz Model:**
- Markowitzâ€™s model focuses on constructing a portfolio that maximizes expected return for a given risk or minimizes risk for a specific return level.

**Mathematical Formulation:**
\[
\max_w \, \frac{w^T \mu - R_f}{\sqrt{w^T \Sigma w}}
\]

**Portfolio Diversification Strategies:**
- Diversification lowers overall portfolio risk by investing in assets with low or negative correlations. The goal is to minimize portfolio variance while achieving a desired return.

**Pseudocode for Diversification:**
```plaintext
1. Initialize portfolio weights
2. Calculate the expected return and variance
3. For each asset in portfolio:
    a. Update weights to minimize variance
    b. Calculate the new portfolio return
4. Return the optimized portfolio weights
```

**Case Studies: Real-World Applications**
- Explore diversified portfolio performance during market stress and recovery periods to illustrate diversification benefits.

#### **Capital Market Line (CML)**

**Understanding the Capital Market Line:**
- The CML shows the risk-return trade-off for portfolios that optimally combine a risk-free asset with the market portfolio.

**Mathematical Expression of the CML:**
\[
\mathbb{E}[R_p] = R_f + \frac{\mathbb{E}[R_m] - R_f}{\sigma_m} \sigma_p
\]

**Pseudocode for CML Construction:**
```plaintext
1. Define risk-free rate (Rf) and market returns (Rm)

```
