```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>

using namespace std;

// Function to calculate Net Present Value (NPV)
double calculateNPV(double initialInvestment, const vector<double>& cashFlows, double discountRate) {
    double npv = 0.0; // Initialize NPV to zero

    // Loop through each year's cash flow
    for (size_t t = 0; t < cashFlows.size(); ++t) {
        // Calculate the present value of the cash flow for year t
        // Cash Flow_t / (1 + r)^t
        double presentValue = cashFlows[t] / pow(1 + discountRate, t + 1);
        npv += presentValue; // Accumulate the present values
    }

    // Subtract the initial investment from the total present value to get NPV
    npv -= initialInvestment;

    return npv; // Return the calculated NPV

2. Develop a financial model to illustrate the difference between real and financial assets, using examples from real-world companies. Analyze how each type of asset impacts a company's valuation.

- Real asset: physical or tangible (Real Estate, Machinery and Equipment, Natural Resources)
- Financial asset: Represents claim to ownership or a contractual right to receive cash of another fnancial asset (Stocks, Bonds, Derivatives)

| Feature                        | Real Assets                                     | Financial Assets                               |
|--------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Nature**                     | Physical, tangible assets                       | Intangible, contractual claims                  |
| **Value Determinants**        | Market demand, condition, location              | Market rates, company performance, creditworthiness |
| **Usage**                      | Used in production or as resources              | Used for investment or liquidity                |
| **Depreciation/Amortization** | Subject to depreciation over time               | Generally do not depreciate, but can fluctuate in value |
| **Liquidity**                  | Generally less liquid, harder to sell quickly  | Usually more liquid, easily tradable           |

3. Choose a non-financial corporation and evaluate how it raises capital. Identify the financial intermediaries involved and discuss the role of capital markets in this process.

- OpenAI: Technological Research Organization and Technological Company
  - Equity Financing: Equity investments from Venture Capital Firms
  - Partnership: In cooperation with large Tech companies.
  - Grants and Donations: From Philanthropists and other Organizations 
- Financial Intermediaries: Venture Capital Firms, Investment Banks, Tech Partners, Philanthropic Organizations
- Role of Capital Markets: Access to funding, Liquiditiy and platform for price discovery, Investors protection

----

4. Create a flow diagram representing the circulation of money between households, non-financial corporations, financial intermediaries, and capital markets. Apply this to a real-world economy, explaining the interaction between these entities.

- Households
  - Member sof a household provide labour and earn wages. They deposit money in the bank as for savings or buy stocks, bonds, invest in Fonds as well.
- Financial Coporations
  - Banks act as intermediaries between households ad none financial cooperations. They invest in capital and loan money to the household.
- Capital Makets
  - NYSE, where etc. Amazon or Google issue stocks and bonds. 

----

5. Compare the valuation of tangible and intangible assets in a chosen company. Discuss how these valuations affect its financial management strategies.

- Tangible asstes are for examples Smartphones, MacBooks or even Corporate Buildings. These asstes have acertain value and depreciate over time according to a fixed schedule.
- Intangible assets are non-physical asstes and provide long-term value to a company. The value of such an asset is hard to measure. Examples for such assets are Intellectual Property, Brand Value, Software and Ecosystem, etc. 

----

6. Analyze the market for a company's stock and discuss the price discovery process. Consider how market value is determined by external factors, irrespective of the company's internal objectives.

- Stock Market - Tesla Inc.:
  - Listed on the NASDAQ
  - Ticker symbol: TSLA
  - Key characteristics: High volatility, Retail Investor INterest, Institutionalholdings, Options market Influence
  - Price discovery process:
    - Market Sentiment: Investor optimism or pessimism can drive Tesla’s stock price up or down.
    - Information Flow: Stock prices reflect new information quickly.
    - Liquidity and Trading Volume: With Tesla being one of the most traded stocks globally, high liquidity allows investors to buy and sell easily, leading to efficient price discovery. 
    - Bid-Ask Spread: In any stock market, the difference between the highest price buyers are willing to pay (bid) and the lowest price sellers are willing to accept (ask) helps in determining the final trading price.

----
Here are the answers to your questions in the specified structure:

### 7. Create a hypothetical scenario where a corporation has to decide between two investment options. Evaluate these options using discounted cash flow analysis, taking into account the time value of money and associated risks.

**Scenario**: ABC Corp. is evaluating two investment options: Option A is to invest in a new manufacturing plant, and Option B is to expand its existing product line with a new product.

**Option A: New Manufacturing Plant**
- Initial investment: $5 million
- Expected cash inflows: $1.2 million per year for 5 years
- Discount rate: 8%

**Option B: Product Line Expansion**
- Initial investment: $2 million
- Expected cash inflows: $600,000 per year for 5 years
- Discount rate: 8%

**Discounted Cash Flow Analysis**:
1. **Option A**:
   \[
   NPV_A = \sum_{t=1}^{5} \frac{1.2 \text{ million}}{(1+0.08)^t} - 5 \text{ million}
   \]

   - NPV Calculation:
     - Year 1: \( \frac{1.2}{1.08} = 1.111 \)
     - Year 2: \( \frac{1.2}{(1.08)^2} = 1.030 \)
     - Year 3: \( \frac{1.2}{(1.08)^3} = 0.952 \)
     - Year 4: \( \frac{1.2}{(1.08)^4} = 0.880 \)
     - Year 5: \( \frac{1.2}{(1.08)^5} = 0.814 \)
     - Total NPV: \( 1.111 + 1.030 + 0.952 + 0.880 + 0.814 - 5 = -0.213 \) million (or -$213,000)

2. **Option B**:
   \[
   NPV_B = \sum_{t=1}^{5} \frac{600,000}{(1+0.08)^t} - 2 \text{ million}
   \]

   - NPV Calculation:
     - Year 1: \( \frac{0.6}{1.08} = 0.556 \)
     - Year 2: \( \frac{0.6}{(1.08)^2} = 0.514 \)
     - Year 3: \( \frac{0.6}{(1.08)^3} = 0.476 \)
     - Year 4: \( \frac{0.6}{(1.08)^4} = 0.440 \)
     - Year 5: \( \frac{0.6}{(1.08)^5} = 0.407 \)
     - Total NPV: \( 0.556 + 0.514 + 0.476 + 0.440 + 0.407 - 2 = -0.207 \) million (or -$207,000)

**Conclusion**: Both options yield negative NPVs, indicating they are not favorable investments. However, Option B has a higher NPV (-$207,000 vs. -$213,000), making it the better choice, despite both options not meeting the required return.

---

### 8. Compare the accounting practices of two companies from different industries. Focus on their balance sheets and income statements to evaluate financial health. Discuss how accounting principles influence financial analysis.

**Companies**: Company X (Technology Sector) vs. Company Y (Retail Sector)

**Balance Sheet Comparison**:
- **Company X (Tech)**:
  - Assets: $10 million (high proportion of intangible assets, R&D)
  - Liabilities: $4 million (low debt, high equity financing)
  - Equity: $6 million

- **Company Y (Retail)**:
  - Assets: $15 million (high proportion of inventory and receivables)
  - Liabilities: $9 million (higher debt due to financing inventory)
  - Equity: $6 million

**Income Statement Comparison**:
- **Company X (Tech)**:
  - Revenue: $5 million
  - Operating Income: $2 million (high margin due to low cost of goods sold)
  - Net Income: $1.5 million

- **Company Y (Retail)**:
  - Revenue: $10 million
  - Operating Income: $1 million (lower margin due to higher COGS)
  - Net Income: $0.5 million

**Financial Health Evaluation**:
- **Liquidity Ratios**: Company Y may show lower current ratios due to higher inventory levels, while Company X's ratios may be better due to lower inventory.
- **Profitability**: Company X shows stronger profitability metrics due to higher margins, reflecting its tech industry dynamics.

**Influence of Accounting Principles**:
- **Revenue Recognition**: Tech companies often use different revenue recognition standards (e.g., software revenue) than retail companies, affecting reported income.
- **Asset Valuation**: The tech sector tends to capitalize on R&D expenses as intangible assets, while the retail sector focuses on inventory valuation.

Overall, accounting principles significantly influence how financial health is interpreted across different industries.

---

### 9. Using real-world financial statements, distinguish between stock and flow variables. Explain the importance of each in financial decision-making.

**Stock Variables**: These are measurements at a specific point in time, such as:
- **Assets**: Cash, inventory, accounts receivable (from the balance sheet).
- **Liabilities**: Accounts payable, short-term debt (from the balance sheet).
- **Equity**: Common stock, retained earnings (from the balance sheet).

**Flow Variables**: These measure activity over a period of time, such as:
- **Revenue**: Total sales made over the fiscal year (from the income statement).
- **Expenses**: Total costs incurred over the same period (from the income statement).
- **Cash Flow**: Cash generated or used over a specific period (from the cash flow statement).

**Importance in Financial Decision-Making**:
- **Stock Variables** help assess a company's financial position at a specific date, crucial for liquidity analysis and solvency assessment. For example, high current assets relative to liabilities indicate good liquidity.
- **Flow Variables** indicate how well a company performs over time, essential for understanding operational efficiency and profitability. For example, sustained revenue growth can indicate successful business strategies.

Both types of variables are crucial for comprehensive financial analysis, aiding stakeholders in evaluating a company’s performance and making informed investment decisions.

---

### 10. Develop a case study of a corporation raising cash through both equity and debt. Explain the impact on the balance sheet and income statement, and analyze which financing method is more effective for the company's growth.

**Case Study: XYZ Corp.**

**Scenario**: XYZ Corp. plans to raise $10 million to expand its operations. It considers issuing $5 million in equity and $5 million in debt.

**Equity Financing**:
- **Impact on Balance Sheet**:
  - Assets increase by $5 million (cash).
  - Equity increases by $5 million (common stock and additional paid-in capital).
  
- **Impact on Income Statement**:
  - No immediate impact on expenses, but future earnings per share (EPS) may be diluted due to more shares outstanding.

**Debt Financing**:
- **Impact on Balance Sheet**:
  - Assets increase by $5 million (cash).
  - Liabilities increase by $5 million (notes payable).
  
- **Impact on Income Statement**:
  - Interest expense increases, reducing net income. Assuming a 5% interest rate, annual interest expense would be $250,000.

**Analysis**:
- **Cost of Capital**: Debt is often cheaper than equity because interest is tax-deductible, making it attractive for funding. 
- **Leverage**: While using debt can enhance returns on equity through leverage, it also increases financial risk, especially if cash flows are uncertain.

**Conclusion**: If XYZ Corp. has stable cash flows and can manage the interest payments, debt financing might be more effective for growth due to lower cost and tax benefits. Conversely, if the company is in a volatile industry, equity financing might be safer, avoiding fixed obligations.

---

### 11. Construct an example of a company’s cash flow cycle, including cash raised, invested, generated, reinvested, and returned to investors. Examine the financial health of a company with an unbalanced cash flow cycle.

**Example: ABC Widgets, Inc.**

**Cash Flow Cycle**:
1. **Cash Raised**: $2 million through equity financing.
2. **Invested**: $1.5 million in manufacturing equipment.
3. **Generated**: $2.5 million in cash from operations (sales of widgets).
4. **Reinvested**: $1 million back into R&D for product development.
5. **Returned to Investors**: $200,000 in dividends paid to shareholders.

**Analysis of Cash Flow Cycle**:
- **Healthy Cycle**: ABC Widgets generates $2.5 million in cash from operations, which is more than sufficient to cover reinvestment needs and returns to investors. This indicates good operational performance.
  
- **Unbalanced Cycle**: If the company had raised $2 million but generated only $1 million in cash from operations, it would face challenges:
  - **Cash Shortfall**: It would have to rely on external financing or increase debt to meet obligations.
  - **Financial Health**: An unbalanced cash flow cycle indicates potential operational inefficiencies and risk of insolvency.

Overall, maintaining a balanced cash flow cycle is

 crucial for financial health, allowing companies to invest in growth while satisfying investor returns.

---

### 12. Identify a company that recently went through a major investment decision. Analyze the impact of this decision on its real and financial assets, as well as on its shareholder value.

**Company: Amazon.com, Inc.**

**Investment Decision**: In 2021, Amazon announced a $4 billion investment to expand its logistics and delivery network.

**Impact on Real Assets**:
- **Increase in Property, Plant, and Equipment (PP&E)**: The investment led to the acquisition of new fulfillment centers and logistics technology, increasing Amazon's real assets on the balance sheet.

**Impact on Financial Assets**:
- **Cash Flow Implications**: While the initial investment decreased cash reserves, the expectation of increased efficiency and faster delivery times is anticipated to boost revenue in the long term.

**Impact on Shareholder Value**:
- **Market Response**: Following the announcement, Amazon's stock price initially dropped due to increased capital expenditures. However, analysts projected long-term growth potential, leading to a rebound.
- **Earnings Growth**: The investment is expected to enhance operational efficiency, potentially increasing earnings per share (EPS) as order fulfillment speeds up.

Overall, the decision reflects Amazon's commitment to maintaining competitive advantage, despite short-term impacts on cash flow and potential market volatility.

---

### 13. Research a company that has experienced financial difficulties. Use accounting analysis to assess what went wrong, focusing on its balance sheet and income statement.

**Company: Sears Holdings Corporation**

**Financial Difficulties**: Sears filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2018.

**Balance Sheet Analysis**:
- **Declining Assets**: Sears' total assets declined significantly, from $19.3 billion in 2013 to approximately $7 billion in 2018. A significant portion was tied up in underperforming real estate.
- **Increasing Liabilities**: Liabilities grew, exceeding assets, leading to negative equity. Total liabilities were around $11 billion, including large debts and unpaid obligations.

**Income Statement Analysis**:
- **Declining Revenues**: Revenues dropped from $25 billion in 2013 to $6.1 billion in 2018 due to store closures and declining sales.
- **Operating Losses**: Operating losses became consistent, with net losses reaching $600 million in 2018, indicating the company's inability to manage costs relative to declining sales.

**Conclusion**: The primary issues were poor inventory management, failure to adapt to e-commerce trends, and high debt levels. The accounting analysis reveals that mismanagement of assets and liabilities, along with sustained losses, led to the company's financial collapse.

---

### 14. Create a financial plan for a company that needs to raise $10 million to expand its operations. Compare the potential sources of financing and suggest the most suitable option.

**Company: Tech Innovators, Inc.**

**Financial Requirement**: $10 million for expansion into new markets.

**Potential Sources of Financing**:
1. **Equity Financing**:
   - **Pros**: No repayment obligation, retains cash flow.
   - **Cons**: Dilution of ownership, potential pressure from shareholders for quick returns.

2. **Debt Financing**:
   - **Pros**: Interest tax-deductible, does not dilute ownership.
   - **Cons**: Fixed repayment obligations, increased financial risk if cash flow is inconsistent.

3. **Convertible Debt**:
   - **Pros**: Provides flexibility to convert to equity later, initially lower interest rates.
   - **Cons**: Future dilution of ownership if converted, interest still has to be paid.

4. **Venture Capital**:
   - **Pros**: Provides both funding and valuable expertise.
   - **Cons**: May require significant control over decision-making and may push for aggressive growth strategies.

**Recommendation**:
- Given Tech Innovators’ growth potential and the need to maintain control, a combination of **debt financing** and **equity financing** could be the best option. This would allow the company to secure the necessary funds while managing the risk of dilution. The company should aim for a debt-equity ratio that maintains financial stability and supports its growth strategy.

---

### 15. Explore the role of risk management in corporate finance by assessing a company’s recent financial statements. Identify the risks the company faces and discuss how they manage these risks.

**Company: Delta Air Lines, Inc.**

**Risk Management Role**:
- Delta faces multiple risks, including fuel price volatility, interest rate fluctuations, and operational risks due to the cyclical nature of the airline industry.

**Financial Statement Assessment**:
- **Balance Sheet**: Delta's liabilities include significant long-term debt, exposing it to interest rate risk.
- **Income Statement**: Fuel costs constitute a major portion of operating expenses, highlighting the company's exposure to fuel price risk.

**Risk Management Strategies**:
1. **Fuel Hedging**: Delta employs fuel hedging strategies to lock in fuel prices, mitigating the impact of price fluctuations on operating costs.
2. **Diversification**: The company diversifies its routes and services, reducing dependency on any single market and spreading risk.
3. **Cost Control**: Delta continually seeks to improve operational efficiencies, managing labor and maintenance costs to maintain profitability during downturns.

**Conclusion**: Delta’s proactive risk management strategies help stabilize its financial performance in a volatile industry, demonstrating the critical role of risk management in corporate finance.

---

### 16. Create a case study on how time and risk influence a company's financial decision-making process. Focus on an investment decision made by a multinational corporation.

**Case Study: Nestlé S.A.**

**Investment Decision**: In 2018, Nestlé announced its decision to invest $1 billion in expanding its plant-based food products line, aiming to capitalize on the growing demand for healthier food options.

**Influence of Time**:
- **Market Timing**: Nestlé recognized the trend towards plant-based diets early, allowing it to capture market share before competitors.
- **Investment Horizon**: The company planned a phased investment strategy over three years to mitigate risk and adapt based on market responses.

- **Operational Risk**: The company considered risks related to supply chain management and production capabilities. To mitigate this, Nestlé partnered with established suppliers of plant-based ingredients.

**Conclusion**: Nestlé's decision was shaped by an understanding of both time and risk factors, emphasizing the importance of strategic planning and market awareness in financial decision-making.

---

### 17. Analyze a company’s dividend policy over the past decade. Discuss how its payout decisions reflect its overall financial strategy and shareholder value creation.

**Company: Coca-Cola Company**

**Dividend Policy Overview**:
- Coca-Cola has consistently paid dividends for over 50 years, demonstrating its commitment to returning value to shareholders.

**Dividend Growth**:
- Over the past decade, Coca-Cola has steadily increased its dividend payout, growing from $1.14 per share in 2010 to $1.68 per share in 2020.

**Reflection of Financial Strategy**:
- **Stable Cash Flow**: Coca-Cola’s strong cash flow generation supports its ability to pay and increase dividends, indicating robust operational performance.
- **Shareholder Value Creation**: The company prioritizes shareholder returns through dividends while balancing reinvestment in growth initiatives, like expanding its product portfolio.

**Conclusion**: Coca-Cola's dividend policy reflects a conservative financial strategy focused on stability and consistent shareholder returns, reinforcing investor confidence and enhancing long-term shareholder value.

---

### 18. Compare and contrast the financial management strategies of two companies operating in different sectors. Focus on their investment, financing, and payout decisions.

**Companies**: Apple Inc. (Technology) vs. Procter & Gamble Co. (Consumer Goods)

**Investment Strategies**:
- **Apple**: Invests heavily in R&D and innovation, focusing on developing new products and technologies. This leads to significant capital expenditures but positions Apple as a market leader.
- **Procter & Gamble**: Focuses on maintaining a diverse product portfolio through strategic acquisitions and product innovation, emphasizing stability and market share.

**Financing Strategies**:
- **Apple**: Uses a mix of debt and equity financing, often issuing bonds to finance share buybacks and dividends while maintaining a strong cash position.
- **Procter & Gamble**: Primarily relies on internal financing and has a conservative debt strategy, maintaining a strong credit rating to support stable operations.

**Payout Decisions**:
- **Apple**: Initiated dividend payments in 2012, focusing on share repurchases as a means to return capital to shareholders while still investing in growth.
- **Procter & Gamble**: Consistently pays dividends and has a long history of increasing payouts, reflecting its stable cash flow and commitment to shareholder returns.

**Conclusion**: Apple’s aggressive growth-focused financial management contrasts with Procter & Gamble’s stability-oriented approach. Both companies effectively align their financial strategies with their business models and market positions.

---

### 19. Develop a model that forecasts a company’s stock price based on its financial statements. Use fundamental analysis to explain the relationships between variables.

**Company: Microsoft Corporation**

**Forecasting Model**:
1. **Earnings per Share (EPS)**: Calculate projected EPS based on historical growth rates. For example, if the EPS for the last year is $8 and the growth rate is 10%, the projected EPS for the next year would be:
   \[
   EPS_{forecast} = EPS_{current} \times (1 + growth\ rate) = 8 \times (1 + 0.10) = 8.8
   \]

2. **Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio**: Use a historical P/E ratio to forecast stock price. If Microsoft's average P/E ratio is 30:


   \[
   Stock\ Price_{forecast} = EPS_{forecast} \times P/E\ ratio = 8.8 \times 30 = 264
   \]
