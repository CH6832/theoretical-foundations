Financial markets are platforms where buyers and sellers trade financial instruments like stocks, bonds, derivatives, and currencies. They facilitate the efficient allocation of resources, liquidity provision, price discovery, and risk sharing.

### Types of Financial Instruments

- **Equity Instruments**: Represent ownership in a company, such as stocks.
- **Debt Instruments**: Represent borrowed funds that must be repaid with interest, such as bonds and loans.
- **Derivatives**: Financial contracts whose value is derived from an underlying asset, such as options and futures.

## Markets and Exchanges

### Financial Markets

- **Stock Markets**: Platforms for trading shares of public companies: NYSE, LSE, TSE, SSE, HKEX, TSX, ASX

## Projects

### Project 1 - Noisy Delta

**Objective**:

The goal of this project is to estimate the "delta" of a financial option in a noisy market environment. The delta is a measure of the sensitivity of the option's price to changes in the price of the underlying asset. By simulating a noisy market environment, we can understand how fluctuations in the underlying asset's price affect the delta and, consequently, the option's pricing and hedging strategies.

**Concepts Covered**:

- Option pricing
- Delta hedging
- Stochastic processes
- Numerical methods

**Python Example**:

Below is a Python example to estimate the delta of a European call option using Monte Carlo simulations in a noisy market environment.

```bash
# Initialize Parameters
Set S0 = 100   # Initial stock price
Set K = 100    # Strike price
Set T = 1.0    # Time to maturity (1 year)
Set r = 0.05   # Risk-free rate
Set sigma = 0.2  # Volatility of the underlying asset
Set num_simulations = 10000  # Number of Monte Carlo simulations
Set num_steps = 100  # Number of time steps

# Function to calculate Black-Scholes delta
Define Function black_scholes_delta(S, K, T, r, sigma):
    Calculate d1 = (log(S / K) + (r + 0.5 * sigma^2) * T) / (sigma * sqrt(T))
    Set delta = cumulative_normal_distribution(d1)  # Use normal CDF
    Return delta

# Function for Monte Carlo simulation to estimate delta
Define Function monte_carlo_delta(S0, K, T, r, sigma, num_simulations, num_steps):
    Set dt = T / num_steps
    Initialize list delta_estimates = []

    # Loop over each simulation
    For each simulation from 1 to num_simulations:
        Set S = S0  # Initial stock price for this simulation

        # Simulate stock price path with noise
        For each time step from 1 to num_steps:
            Generate random noise from a normal distribution
            Update S using the formula:
            S = S * exp((r - 0.5 * sigma^2) * dt + sigma * noise * sqrt(dt))

        # Calculate delta at the end of simulation
        Set delta = black_scholes_delta(S, K, T, r, sigma)
        Append delta to delta_estimates

    # Calculate the mean and standard deviation of delta estimates
    Set delta_mean = mean(delta_estimates)
    Set delta_std = standard_deviation(delta_estimates)

    Return delta_mean, delta_std

# Run the simulation
Call monte_carlo_delta(S0, K, T, r, sigma, num_simulations, num_steps)

Print "Estimated Delta: ", delta_mean
Print "Delta Standard Deviation: ", delta_std

# Plot the distribution of delta estimates (optional, conceptual step)
```

**Explanation**:

- The `black_scholes_delta` function computes the delta of a European call option using the Black-Scholes formula.
- The `monte_carlo_delta` function runs a Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the delta under noisy market conditions. It simulates the stock price path and computes the delta at each step.
- The histogram of delta estimates shows the distribution of delta values, which can help in understanding the impact of market noise on delta estimation.

### Project 2 - Kalman Filter

**Objective**:

This project involves using the Kalman Filter to estimate the value of an asset over time, accounting for noise and uncertainty in the observations. The Kalman Filter is a recursive algorithm that provides an optimal estimate of the true value of a variable based on a series of noisy observations.

**Concepts Covered**:

- State-space models
- Recursive estimation
- Filtering and smoothing techniques
- Financial time series analysis

**Python Example**:

Below is a Python example to implement the Kalman Filter for estimating the price of an asset.

```bash
# Initialize Libraries
Import necessary libraries:
    Import numpy for numerical computations
    Import matplotlib for plotting

# Simulated Parameters
Set random seed for reproducibility
Set n_timesteps = 50  # Number of time steps
Set true_value = 100  # Initial true value of the asset
Set process_noise = 1  # Noise in the asset's true value changes
Set measurement_noise = 2  # Noise in the observed measurements

# Initialize Arrays for True Values and Measurements
Create array true_values of size n_timesteps, initialized to zero
Create array measurements of size n_timesteps, initialized to zero

# Simulate the True Values and Noisy Measurements
For each time step t from 0 to n_timesteps:
    If t == 0:
        Set true_values[t] = true_value  # Initial true value
    Else:
        Update true_values[t] = true_values[t-1] + random number from normal distribution with mean 0 and process_noise

    Set measurements[t] = true_values[t] + random number from normal distribution with mean 0 and measurement_noise

# Kalman Filter Implementation
Define Function kalman_filter(measurements, process_noise, measurement_noise):
    Set n_timesteps = length of measurements
    Create array x_est of size n_timesteps, initialized to zero  # Estimated asset value
    Create array p_est of size n_timesteps, initialized to zero  # Estimated variance

    # Initial guesses
    Set x_est[0] = measurements[0]  # Initial estimate based on first measurement
    Set p_est[0] = 1.0  # Initial variance estimate

    # Loop through all time steps
    For each time step t from 1 to n_timesteps:
        # Prediction step
        Set x_pred = x_est[t-1]  # Predict current state from previous estimate
        Set p_pred = p_est[t-1] + process_noise  # Predict variance with added process noise

        # Update step
        Calculate kalman_gain = p_pred / (p_pred + measurement_noise)  # Kalman gain
        Update x_est[t] = x_pred + kalman_gain * (measurements[t] - x_pred)  # Correct prediction using the measurement
        Update p_est[t] = (1 - kalman_gain) * p_pred  # Update variance

    Return x_est, p_est

# Run the Kalman Filter
Call kalman_filter with inputs (measurements, process_noise, measurement_noise)
Store the results in estimated_values and estimated_variances

# Plotting the Results
Plot true_values as 'True Value' (dashed black line)
Plot measurements as 'Measurements' (blue line with transparency)
Plot estimated_values as 'Kalman Filter Estimate' (red line)

# Add uncertainty bounds around Kalman estimates
Fill area between (estimated_values - standard deviation) and (estimated_values + standard deviation) with red color and transparency

# Add title, labels, and legend to the plot
Display the plot

```

**Explanation**:

- The code first simulates the true asset value and noisy measurements over time. The true value evolves according to a random walk, and the measurements are the true value plus some noise.
- The `kalman_filter` function estimates the asset's true value over time using the Kalman Filter. It takes the noisy measurements and recursively updates the estimate and its uncertainty.
- The plot shows the true value, the noisy measurements, and the Kalman Filter's estimate, along with the uncertainty around the estimate.

**Applications**:

- The Kalman Filter is widely used in finance for filtering and smoothing time series data, such as in high-frequency trading, risk management, and estimating volatility.
