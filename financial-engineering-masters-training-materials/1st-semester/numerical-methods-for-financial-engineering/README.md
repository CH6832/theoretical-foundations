# Numerical Methods for Financial Engineering

## Course Overview
This course focuses on the application of numerical methods to problems in financial engineering. It covers the mathematical and statistical techniques used to model, analyze, and solve financial problems. The course integrates theory with practical applications, emphasizing the use of numerical methods in real-world financial scenarios.

## Topics Covered

### Probability Theory
- **Random Variables and Distributions:**
  - Understanding the role of random variables in financial modeling.
  - Key probability distributions used in finance (e.g., normal, log-normal).
- **Expectation and Moments:**
  - Calculation of expected values and higher moments (variance, skewness, kurtosis).
  - Applications of expectation and moments in risk assessment.

### Statistical Inference
- **Hypothesis Testing:**
  - Principles of statistical hypothesis testing in financial contexts.
  - Common tests (e.g., t-tests, chi-square tests) and their applications.
- **Confidence Intervals:**
  - Construction and interpretation of confidence intervals for financial data.
  - Applications in financial decision-making under uncertainty.
- **Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE):**
  - MLE techniques for estimating model parameters.
  - Applications in financial models, including volatility estimation.

### Linear Regression
- **Ordinary Least Squares (OLS):**
  - Fundamentals of linear regression using OLS.
  - Application of OLS in financial data analysis and forecasting.
- **Diagnostics and Multicollinearity:**
  - Diagnostic tests for model validity (e.g., residual analysis, R-squared).
  - Handling multicollinearity and its effects on regression models.
- **Heteroscedasticity:**
  - Identifying and addressing heteroscedasticity in financial time series data.
  - Robust regression techniques to manage non-constant variance.

### Time Series Analysis
- **ARIMA Models:**
  - Introduction to AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models.
  - Applications in financial forecasting and trend analysis.
- **GARCH Models and Volatility Clustering:**
  - Understanding Generalized AutoRegressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) models.
  - Modeling and forecasting financial market volatility.

## Assessment Methods
- **Problem Sets:** Regular assignments to practice and reinforce numerical methods in finance.
- **Midterm Exam:** A comprehensive exam covering the first half of the course material.
- **Final Exam:** A detailed exam testing the full range of topics covered in the course.
- **Programming Projects:** Practical projects involving the implementation of numerical methods for financial data analysis.
