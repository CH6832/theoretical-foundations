### **Probability Theory**
Here are the answers to your questions structured as requested:

### 1. **Discrete Random Variables:**
   - To compute the expected value and variance for the number of heads in 10 coin flips, we can use the properties of the binomial distribution. Each coin flip can be modeled as a Bernoulli trial with \(p = 0.5\). The expected value \(E[X]\) for a binomial random variable is given by:
     \[
     E[X] = n \cdot p
     \]
     The variance \(Var(X)\) is given by:
     \[
     Var(X) = n \cdot p \cdot (1 - p)
     \]
     For \(n = 10\) and \(p = 0.5\):
     \[
     E[X] = 10 \cdot 0.5 = 5
     \]
     \[
     Var(X) = 10 \cdot 0.5 \cdot 0.5 = 2.5
     \]
   - A Python simulation can confirm these results:
     ```python
     import numpy as np

     # Simulate 10 coin flips, 10000 times
     trials = 10000
     flips = np.random.binomial(n=10, p=0.5, size=trials)

     expected_value = np.mean(flips)
     variance = np.var(flips)

     expected_value, variance
     ```

### 2. **Continuous Random Variables:**
   - For a continuous random variable \(X\) with the given probability density function (PDF), the probability \(P(\mu - \sigma \leq X \leq \mu + \sigma)\) can be calculated using the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the normal distribution. With \(\mu = 0\) and \(\sigma = 1\):
     \[
     P(-1 \leq X \leq 1) = P(X \leq 1) - P(X \leq -1)
     \]
     Using the standard normal distribution table or a cumulative distribution function, we find:
     \[
     P(X \leq 1) = 0.8413
     \]
     \[
     P(X \leq -1) = 0.1587
     \]
     Thus:
     \[
     P(-1 \leq X \leq 1) = 0.8413 - 0.1587 = 0.6826
     \]

### 3. **Normal Distribution:**
   - To simulate a dataset of 1,000 daily returns following a normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation 0.02:
     ```python
     import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

     # Simulate 1000 daily returns
     returns = np.random.normal(0, 0.02, 1000)

     # Compute sample mean and standard deviation
     sample_mean = np.mean(returns)
     sample_std = np.std(returns)

     # Create histogram
     plt.hist(returns, bins=30, alpha=0.7, color='blue')
     plt.title('Histogram of Daily Returns')
     plt.xlabel('Returns')
     plt.ylabel('Frequency')
     plt.show()

     sample_mean, sample_std
     ```

### 4. **Log-Normal Distribution:**
   - To generate a log-normal distribution sample with \(\mu = 0\) and \(\sigma = 0.1\), and compare it with the histogram of the log-transformed data:
     ```python
     # Generate log-normal distribution sample
     log_normal_sample = np.random.lognormal(mean=0, sigma=0.1, size=1000)
     normal_sample = np.log(log_normal_sample)

     # Create histograms
     plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
     plt.subplot(1, 2, 1)
     plt.hist(log_normal_sample, bins=30, alpha=0.7, color='red')
     plt.title('Log-Normal Distribution')
     plt.subplot(1, 2, 2)
     plt.hist(normal_sample, bins=30, alpha=0.7, color='green')
     plt.title('Normal Distribution of Log-Transformed Data')
     plt.show()
     ```

### 5. **Expectation and Variance:**
   - Given a discrete random variable with values \(\{1, 2, 3\}\) and probabilities \(\{0.2, 0.5, 0.3\}\):
     - Expectation:
     \[
     E[X] = 1 \cdot 0.2 + 2 \cdot 0.5 + 3 \cdot 0.3 = 0.2 + 1 + 0.9 = 2.1
     \]
     - Variance:
     \[
     Var(X) = E[X^2] - (E[X])^2
     \]
     Where:
     \[
     E[X^2] = 1^2 \cdot 0.2 + 2^2 \cdot 0.5 + 3^2 \cdot 0.3 = 0.2 + 2 + 2.7 = 4.9
     \]
     Thus:
     \[
     Var(X) = 4.9 - (2.1)^2 = 4.9 - 4.41 = 0.49
     \]
   - Confirming with simulation:
     ```python
     values = [1, 2, 3]
     probabilities = [0.2, 0.5, 0.3]
     trials = np.random.choice(values, size=10000, p=probabilities)

     expected_value_sim = np.mean(trials)
     variance_sim = np.var(trials)

     expected_value_sim, variance_sim
     ```

### 6. **Skewness and Kurtosis:**
   - To compute the skewness and kurtosis for a dataset of financial returns:
     ```python
     from scipy.stats import skew, kurtosis

     # Simulated financial returns
     returns = np.random.normal(0, 0.02, 1000)

     skewness = skew(returns)
     kurt = kurtosis(returns)

     skewness, kurt
     ```
   - **Interpretation:**
     - A positive skewness indicates that the distribution has a long right tail, which may suggest potential for higher returns. 
     - High kurtosis indicates more frequent extreme values (outliers) in returns, increasing risk. 
     - Investors may need to adjust their risk management strategies based on these statistics.

### 7. **Monte Carlo Simulation of Normal Returns:**
   - Simulating 10,000 returns from a normal distribution and estimating the 95th percentile:
     ```python
     # Simulate 10000 returns
     monte_carlo_returns = np.random.normal(0, 0.02, 10000)

     # Estimate the 95th percentile
     percentile_95 = np.percentile(monte_carlo_returns, 95)

     # Create confidence intervals
     mean_return = np.mean(monte_carlo_returns)
     std_error = np.std(monte_carlo_returns) / np.sqrt(10000)
     confidence_interval = (mean_return - 1.96 * std_error, mean_return + 1.96 * std_error)

     percentile_95, confidence_interval
     ```

### 8. **Expectation with Discrete Random Variables:**
   - The expected value of a random variable representing the outcome of rolling two six-sided dice involves:
     - The outcomes range from 2 (1+1) to 12 (6+6). 
     - Each outcome \(x\) has a probability \(P(X = x)\), derived from counting combinations that produce \(x\).
   - The expected value \(E[X]\) can be calculated as:
     \[
     E[X] = \sum_{x=2}^{12} x \cdot P(X = x)
     \]
     Which can be shown to equal 7, as follows:
     \[
     E[X] = \frac{1}{36} \sum_{i=1}^{6} \sum_{j=1}^{6} (i + j) = \frac{1}{36} \cdot 252 = 7
     \]

### 9. **Variance Calculation:**
   - Given a continuous random variable with a known PDF, variance can be computed using numerical integration. For a normal distribution:
     \[
     Var(X) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} (x - \mu)^2 f_X(x) \, dx
     \]
   - For numerical integration:
     ```python
     from scipy.integrate import quad

     def integrand(x, mu=0, sigma=1):
         return (x - mu)**2 * (1 / (np.sqrt(2 * np.pi) * sigma)) * np.exp(-0.5 * ((x - mu) / sigma) ** 2)

     variance_numerical, _ = quad(integrand, -np.inf, np.inf)
     ```
   - Comparing with analytical results shows both approaches yield \(1\) for \(\sigma = 1\).

### 10. **Moment Generating Functions:**
   - The moment-generating function (MGF) of a normal distribution \(N(\mu, \sigma^2)\) is given by:
     \[
     M_X(t) = \exp\left(\mu t + \frac{\sigma^2 t^2}{2

}\right)
     \]
   - From the MGF, the mean \(E[X] = M'_X(0) = \mu\) and variance \(Var(X) = M''_X(0) - (M'_X(0))^2 = \sigma^2\).
   - **Implications for Risk Assessment:**
     - Understanding the mean and variance helps assess the risk associated with a normal distribution of returns.

### **Statistical Inference**

### 11. **t-Test for Two Independent Samples:**
   - To perform a t-test comparing the means of daily returns from two different stocks:
     ```python
     from scipy.stats import ttest_ind

     stock_b_returns = np.random.normal(0.015, 0.02, 100)

     t_stat, p_value = ttest_ind(stock_a_returns, stock_b_returns)

     t_stat, p_value
     ```
   - **Interpretation:**
     - A low p-value (typically <0.05) would suggest a significant difference in means, implying differing performance between the two stocks.

### 12. **Chi-Square Test for Independence:**
   - Conducting a chi-square test to determine the relationship between two categorical financial variables:
     ```python
     from scipy.stats import chi2_contingency

     data = np.array([[50, 30], [20, 100]])  # Example contingency table
     chi2, p, _, _ = chi2_contingency(data)

     chi2, p
     ```
   - **Interpretation:**
     - A low p-value indicates a significant relationship between the two variables, influencing financial decisions based on their association.

     p_value = 2 * (1 - norm.cdf(abs(positive_returns/100 - 0.5) / np.sqrt(0.5 * (1 - 0.5) / 100)))

     p_value
     ```
   - **Analysis:**
     - A significant result suggests the stock has consistently outperformed or underperformed the market.

### 16. **Comparing Means with Paired t-Test:**
   - Performing a paired t-test to compare returns before and after a major event:
     ```python
     before_event = np.random.normal(0.01, 0.02, 50)
     after_event = np.random.normal(0.015, 0.02, 50)

     t_stat, p_value = ttest_rel(before_event, after_event)

     t_stat, p_value
     ```
   - **Discussion:**
     - A significant difference would suggest the event had a measurable impact on stock performance.

### 17. **Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test:**
   - Applying the Wilcoxon signed-rank test to assess if the median of daily returns differs from zero:
     ```python
     from scipy.stats import wilcoxon

     daily_returns = np.random.normal(0, 0.02, 100)
     statistic, p_value = wilcoxon(daily_returns)

     statistic, p_value
     ```
   - **Interpretation:**
     - A low p-value indicates instability, affecting investor confidence.

### 18. **Bayesian Hypothesis Testing:**
   - Using Bayesian methods to compare financial model fits:
     ```python
     import pymc3 as pm

     with pm.Model() as model:
         # Define priors, likelihoods, and compute posterior
         pass  # This part needs your specific model details
     ```
   - **Discussion:**
     - The choice of prior can influence results, and careful selection is crucial for accurate conclusions.

### 19. **Confidence Interval for Proportion:**
   - Computing a confidence interval for the proportion of days a stock's return exceeds a certain threshold:
     ```python
     # Simulate returns
     returns = np.random.normal(0.01, 0.02, 100)
     threshold = 0.005
     proportion_positive = np.mean(returns > threshold)

     std_error = np.sqrt((proportion_positive * (1 - proportion_positive)) / len(returns))
     confidence_interval = (proportion_positive - 1.96 * std_error, proportion_positive + 1.96 * std_error)

     confidence_interval
     ```
   - **Analysis:**
     - This information helps strategize based on the likelihood of exceeding expectations.

### 20. **Goodness-of-Fit Test:**

     expected_freq = np.array([len(returns) * (norm.cdf(x + 0.1) - norm.cdf(x)) for x in observed_freq[:-1]])

     chi2_stat, p_value = chisquare(observed_freq, expected_freq)

     chi2_stat, p_value
     ```
   - **Interpretation:**
     - A significant result suggests departures from normality, crucial for risk assessment.

### **Linear Regression**
