# Stochastic Calculus and Financial Derivatives

## Course Overview
This course provides an in-depth exploration of stochastic calculus and its applications in financial derivatives. It covers fundamental concepts such as Brownian motion, stochastic differential equations, and various option pricing models, with a focus on both theoretical understanding and practical applications.

- **Geometric Brownian Motion:**
  - Application of geometric Brownian motion in modeling stock prices.
  - Use in the derivation of the Black-Scholes model.

### Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs)
- **Ito’s Lemma:**
  - Introduction to Ito calculus and its application in financial modeling.
  - Derivation and application of Ito’s Lemma in solving SDEs.
- **Girsanov’s Theorem:**

### Option Pricing Models
- **Black-Scholes Model:**
  - Detailed derivation and explanation of the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
  - Understanding the assumptions, implications, and limitations of the model.
- **The Greeks:**
  - Introduction to the Greeks (Delta, Gamma, Vega, Theta, Rho) and their significance.
  - Application of the Greeks in risk management and option trading.
- **Volatility Surface:**
  - Understanding the concept of volatility surface and its construction.
  - Implications of the volatility smile and skew on option pricing.

### Exotic Options
