# Quantitative Methods in Finance

## Course Overview
This course provides a comprehensive introduction to the quantitative methods used in finance, emphasizing statistical and mathematical techniques essential for financial analysis and decision-making. The course integrates theory with practical applications, covering a range of topics from probability theory to time series analysis.

## Topics Covered

### Probability Theory
- **Random Variables and Distributions:**
  - Introduction to random variables and probability distributions.
  - Key distributions in finance, such as normal and log-normal distributions.
- **Expectation and Moments:**
  - Calculation of expected values and moments (mean, variance, skewness, kurtosis).
  - Application of moments in risk management and financial modeling.

### Statistical Inference
- **Hypothesis Testing:**
  - Principles of hypothesis testing in financial contexts.
  - Applications in determining statistical significance in financial data.
- **Confidence Intervals:**
  - Constructing and interpreting confidence intervals for financial metrics.
  - Use of confidence intervals in investment decision-making.
- **Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE):**
  - Techniques for estimating parameters of financial models using MLE.
  - Applications in risk modeling and option pricing.

### Linear Regression
- **Ordinary Least Squares (OLS):**
  - Fundamentals of OLS regression in financial data analysis.
  - Application of OLS in predicting asset prices and returns.
- **Diagnostics and Multicollinearity:**
  - Assessing the validity of regression models with diagnostic tests.
  - Addressing multicollinearity issues in financial regressions.
- **Heteroscedasticity:**
  - Identifying and correcting heteroscedasticity in financial data.
  - Robust regression techniques for dealing with non-constant variance.

### Time Series Analysis
- **ARIMA Models:**
  - Understanding and applying AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models.
  - Forecasting financial time series data with ARIMA models.
- **GARCH Models and Volatility Clustering:**
  - Introduction to Generalized AutoRegressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) models.
  - Modeling and predicting volatility in financial markets.

## Assessment Methods
- **Problem Sets:** Regular assignments to practice quantitative methods in finance.
- **Midterm Exam:** Testing comprehension of the first half of the course material.
- **Final Exam:** Comprehensive exam covering all topics discussed in the course.
- **Project Work:** Application of quantitative methods to real-world financial data analysis.
