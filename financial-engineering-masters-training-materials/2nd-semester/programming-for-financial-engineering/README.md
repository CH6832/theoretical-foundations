# Programming for Financial Engineering

## Course Overview
This course is designed to equip students with the programming skills necessary to tackle complex problems in financial engineering. The focus is on using Python and R for financial applications, including data analysis, algorithmic trading, and financial modeling. Students will learn to apply object-oriented programming, data science techniques, and machine learning to real-world financial problems.

## Topics Covered

### Python/R for Finance
- **Data Structures:**
  - Introduction to data structures in Python (lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets) and R (vectors, matrices, data frames).
  - Handling financial data using Pandas and R DataFrames.
  - Efficient data manipulation techniques for large datasets.
- **Financial Libraries:**
  - Overview of essential financial libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, SciPy in Python.
  - Utilizing R packages for statistical analysis and financial modeling.
  - Implementing financial calculations, including time series analysis, risk metrics, and option pricing.

### Object-Oriented Programming
- **Classes and Objects:**
  - Introduction to classes, objects, and methods in Python and R.
  - Creating reusable code through encapsulation, constructors, and destructors.
- **Inheritance and Polymorphism:**
  - Leveraging inheritance to build hierarchical financial models.
  - Implementing polymorphism to enhance flexibility in financial applications.
- **Design Patterns:**
  - Application of design patterns (e.g., Singleton, Factory, Strategy) in financial software development.
  - Best practices for structuring large financial systems using object-oriented principles.

### Algorithmic Trading
- **Backtesting Strategies:**
  - Developing and implementing backtesting frameworks in Python and R.
  - Evaluation of trading strategies using historical data.
  - Metrics for performance assessment, such as Sharpe ratio and drawdown analysis.
- **Portfolio Optimization:**
  - Techniques for constructing and optimizing investment portfolios.
  - Application of Markowitz portfolio theory, risk parity, and Black-Litterman models.
  - Programming optimization algorithms for asset allocation.
- **Execution Algorithms:**
  - Developing execution algorithms such as VWAP, TWAP, and implementation shortfall strategies.
  - Understanding market impact and slippage in trade execution.
  - Simulating execution strategies under different market conditions.

### Data Science Techniques
- **Machine Learning in Finance:**
  - Introduction to supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms (e.g., regression, classification, clustering).
  - Application of machine learning techniques to financial data for predictive modeling.
  - Case studies: Predicting stock prices, credit scoring, and fraud detection.
- **Big Data Analytics:**
  - Handling and processing large-scale financial data using big data technologies (e.g., Hadoop, Spark).
  - Real-time data streaming and analysis for high-frequency trading.
- **Neural Networks:**
  - Basics of neural networks and deep learning models.
  - Application of neural networks in time series forecasting and sentiment analysis.
  - Implementing neural networks for algorithmic trading strategies and financial prediction tasks.

## Assessment Methods
- **Problem Sets:** Regular assignments focusing on the application of Python and R in financial data analysis, modeling, and algorithm development.
- **Midterm Exam:** An assessment covering data structures, financial libraries, and object-oriented programming concepts.
- **Final Exam:** A comprehensive exam that includes algorithmic trading, portfolio optimization, and data science techniques.
