# **Programming for Financial Engineering**

## **Course Overview**

This course equips students with advanced programming skills tailored for solving complex financial engineering problems using Python and R. Students will engage with data analysis, algorithmic trading, financial modeling, machine learning applications, and quantitative finance principles. Real-world projects will empower students to implement, analyze, and critically evaluate financial models and trading strategies.

## **Topics Covered**

### **1. Python/R for Finance**

#### **Data Structures**

- **Python Data Structures:**
  
  In addition to basic data structures, students will explore:
  
  - **Numpy Arrays and Matrix Operations:** Use of numpy for fast and efficient calculations, particularly for large datasets.
  
    ```python
    import numpy as np
    
    # Example: Covariance matrix calculation
    returns = np.random.randn(1000, 5)  # Simulated returns for 5 assets
    cov_matrix = np.cov(returns, rowvar=False)
    print("Covariance Matrix:\n", cov_matrix)
    ```

  - **Real-World Example:** Use numpy for financial calculations such as covariance, correlation, and portfolio variance to develop insights into asset relationships.

- **R Data Structures:**
  
  Students will learn to manipulate complex financial datasets using R's advanced structures, such as:
  
  - **Lists and Factors:** Managing categorical data and creating multi-dimensional financial models.
  
    ```r
    # Creating a list for a portfolio of stocks
    stock_portfolio <- list(Stock_A = c(100, 200, 300), Stock_B = c(150, 250, 350))
    print(stock_portfolio)
    ```

  - **Real-World Example:** Analyze historical stock data using lists to organize multiple stocks and compute portfolio metrics.

#### **Financial Libraries**

- **Advanced Python Libraries:**

  - **QuantLib** for pricing complex derivatives and fixed income securities.
  
    ```python
    import QuantLib as ql

    # Example: Pricing a European Call Option
    S = 100  # Stock price
    K = 100  # Strike price
    T = 1    # Time to maturity
    r = 0.05 # Risk-free rate
    sigma = 0.2 # Volatility
    
    payoff = ql.PlainVanillaPayoff(ql.Option.Call, K)
    european_option = ql.VanillaOption(payoff, ql.EuropeanExercise(ql.Date(T)))
    # Pricing logic...
    ```

  - **Real-World Example:** Use QuantLib for pricing and analyzing exotic options, allowing students to develop complex derivatives pricing strategies.

- **Advanced R Libraries:**

  - **caret** for building and evaluating machine learning models within the financial context.
  
    ```r
    library(caret)

    # Example: Training a model
    model <- train(Target ~ ., data = train_data, method = "rf")
    print(model)
    ```

  - **Real-World Example:** Build predictive models for stock price movement using caret, evaluating model accuracy across multiple machine learning algorithms.

### **2. Object-Oriented Programming**

#### **Classes and Objects**

- **Advanced Class Structures:**
  
  Students will design a **Financial Instrument** superclass with subclasses for different instruments (e.g., stocks, bonds, options).

  ```python
  class FinancialInstrument:
      def __init__(self, name, price):
          self.name = name
          self.price = price

  class Stock(FinancialInstrument):
      def __init__(self, name, price, dividend_yield):
          super().__init__(name, price)
          self.dividend_yield = dividend_yield

      def expected_return(self):
          return self.price * self.dividend_yield

  # Example usage
  apple_stock = Stock("AAPL", 150, 0.012)
  print(f"Expected Return for {apple_stock.name}: {apple_stock.expected_return()}")
  ```

- **Real-World Example:** Students can create a portfolio management system that dynamically tracks and evaluates various financial instruments.

#### **Design Patterns**

- **Advanced Strategy Patterns:**
  
  Implement more complex trading strategies, such as multi-factor models or sentiment analysis-based strategies.

  ```python
  class SentimentAnalysisStrategy(TradingStrategy):
      def execute(self, data):
          # Implement sentiment analysis on market news data
          sentiment_scores = perform_sentiment_analysis(data['news'])
          signals = np.where(sentiment_scores > 0, 1, 0)
          return pd.Series(signals, index=data.index)
  ```

- **Real-World Example:** Analyze news sentiment data alongside price data to optimize trading decisions based on market sentiment.

### **3. Algorithmic Trading**

#### **Backtesting Strategies**

- **Comprehensive Backtesting Framework:**
  
  Develop a robust backtesting framework that incorporates slippage, commission, and risk management.

  ```python
  def backtest_with_costs(prices, strategy, transaction_costs):
      signals = strategy(prices)
      returns = signals.shift(1) * prices.pct_change() - transaction_costs
      cumulative_returns = (1 + returns).cumprod()
      return cumulative_returns
  ```

- **Real-World Example:** Students simulate different market scenarios, including low and high volatility, to understand how their strategies perform under varying conditions.

#### **Portfolio Optimization**

- **Advanced Portfolio Optimization Techniques:**

  - **Mean-Variance Optimization:**
  
    Implementing modern portfolio theory using more advanced techniques like **Black-Litterman** for incorporating investor views into the optimization process.

    ```python
    # Example: Black-Litterman Model
    def black_litterman(expected_market_returns, tau, omega, P, Q):
        # Implement Black-Litterman formula for adjusted returns
        pass
    ```

- **Real-World Example:** Students can create a dashboard that visualizes optimal portfolio weights and risk levels based on current market conditions.

#### **Execution Algorithms**

- **Advanced Execution Algorithms:**
  
  Implement sophisticated execution strategies, including TWAP (Time Weighted Average Price) and VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price).

  ```python
  def twap_execution(prices, volumes, time_intervals):
      # Implementation of TWAP algorithm
      pass
  ```

- **Real-World Example:** Analyze the impact of execution strategies on trade outcomes and transaction costs in a simulated trading environment.

### **4. Financial Modeling**

#### **Statistical Analysis**

- **Advanced Statistical Techniques:**
  
  Integrate time-series analysis methods like **GARCH** (Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity) to model and forecast asset volatility.

  ```python
  from arch import arch_model
  
  # Example: GARCH model for volatility estimation
  model = arch_model(returns['Asset'], vol='Garch', p=1, q=1)
  model_fit = model.fit()
  print(model_fit.summary())
  ```

- **Real-World Example:** Use GARCH models to analyze and predict volatility in a portfolio context, allowing students to understand risk management better.

#### **Machine Learning for Finance**

- **Deep Learning Techniques:**
  
  Implement recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or long short-term memory (LSTM) networks for time-series predictions of financial data.

  ```python
  from keras.models import Sequential
  from keras.layers import LSTM, Dense

  # Building an LSTM model
  model = Sequential()
  model.add(LSTM(50, return_sequences=True, input_shape=(timesteps, features)))
  model.add(LSTM(50))
  model.add(Dense(1))
  model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mean_squared_error')
  ```

- **Real-World Example:** Students can build and evaluate predictive models for market indices or individual stocks based on historical data.

### **5. Risk Management and Derivatives Pricing**

#### **Risk Metrics**

- **Value at Risk (VaR) and Conditional VaR:**

  Use historical simulation or parametric methods to calculate risk metrics.

  ```python
  def calculate_var(returns, confidence_level):
      return np.percentile(returns, 100 * (1 - confidence_level))
  ```

- **Real-World Example:** Students assess portfolio risk exposure using VaR calculations to better understand the potential financial impact of market movements.

#### **Derivatives Pricing**

- **Complex Derivatives:**

  Pricing options with advanced techniques like finite difference methods for American options or Monte Carlo simulations for path-dependent options.

  ```python
  def monte_carlo_option_pricing(S0, K, T, r, sigma, n_simulations):
      # Implementation of Monte Carlo simulation for option pricing
      pass
  ```

- **Real-World Example:** Analyze pricing strategies for complex derivatives like barrier options or Asian options, allowing students to explore a wider range of financial instruments.
