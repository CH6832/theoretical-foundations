# Financial Econometrics

## Course Overview
Financial Econometrics is a specialized field at the intersection of finance, economics, mathematics, and statistics. This course focuses on applying statistical and econometric methods to financial market data, aiming to understand, model, and forecast financial phenomena. The course is essential for anyone involved in quantitative finance, risk management, portfolio management, and financial research.
