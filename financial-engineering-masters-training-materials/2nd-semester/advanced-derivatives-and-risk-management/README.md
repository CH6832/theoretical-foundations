# Advanced Derivatives and Risk Management

## Course Overview
This course focuses on advanced concepts in derivatives and risk management, covering sophisticated financial instruments and strategies used to manage various types of risk. The course also delves into the regulatory frameworks and methodologies for assessing and mitigating financial risks.

## Topics Covered

### Interest Rate Derivatives
- **Swaps:**
  - Detailed understanding of interest rate swaps, currency swaps, and their applications in risk management.
  - Pricing, valuation, and hedging strategies for swaps.
- **Caps and Floors:**
  - Introduction to interest rate caps and floors, their payoff structures, and usage in interest rate risk management.
  - Valuation techniques and practical applications in managing interest rate exposure.
- **Swaptions:**
  - Understanding of swaptions (swap options), their pricing models, and their role in managing interest rate volatility.
  - Hedging strategies involving swaptions.
- **Short-Rate Models:**
  - Exploration of short-rate models such as the Vasicek and Cox-Ingersoll-Ross (CIR) models.
  - Application of these models in the valuation of interest rate derivatives.

### Credit Risk
- **Credit Default Swaps (CDS):**
  - Understanding the structure and function of credit default swaps.
  - Pricing models, market practices, and risk management applications of CDS.
- **Collateralized Debt Obligations (CDOs):**
  - Introduction to collateralized debt obligations, their structure, and the role they played in the financial crisis.

### Value at Risk (VaR)
- **Historical Simulation:**
  - Techniques for calculating VaR using historical data.
  - Advantages and limitations of historical simulation in risk management.
- **Parametric Methods:**
  - Overview of parametric methods (e.g., variance-covariance approach) for VaR calculation.
  - Application of the normal and log-normal distribution assumptions in VaR estimation.
- **Stress Testing:**
  - Methods for stress testing portfolios to assess potential losses under extreme market conditions.
  - Integration of stress testing results into the overall risk management framework.
- **Expected Shortfall:**
  - Understanding expected shortfall as an alternative to VaR.
  - Calculation and interpretation of expected shortfall in risk management.

### Risk Management Frameworks
- **Basel Accords:**
  - Overview of the Basel Accords (Basel I, II, III) and their impact on bank capital requirements and risk management practices.
  - Discussion of regulatory capital, liquidity requirements, and leverage ratios.
- **Enterprise Risk Management (ERM):**
  - Introduction to ERM and its importance in modern financial institutions.
  - Strategies for implementing ERM, including risk identification, measurement, and mitigation.
- **Credit Risk Mitigation:**
  - Techniques for mitigating credit risk, including collateral management, netting agreements, and credit enhancements.
  - Discussion of the effectiveness and challenges of credit risk mitigation strategies.

## Assessment Methods
