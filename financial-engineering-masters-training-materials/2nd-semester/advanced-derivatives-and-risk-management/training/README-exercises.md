### 1. Fixed vs. Floating Analysis
**Problem:** Given a company’s floating-rate loan and an interest rate swap to exchange floating payments for fixed payments, compute the fixed rate required to make the swap fair at inception.

**Solution:**  
To make the swap fair at inception, the present value (PV) of expected floating payments must equal the PV of fixed payments. The fixed rate $( R_f )$ can be calculated using the following formula:

$[R_f = \frac{\sum_{t=1}^{n} PV(Floating\ Payments_t)}{\sum_{t=1}^{n} PV(1)} = \frac{\sum_{t=1}^{n} \frac{Floating\ Rate_t \cdot Notional}{(1 + r_t)^t}}{ \sum_{t=1}^{n} \frac{Notional}{(1 + r_t)^t}} ]$

Where:
- $( PV(Floating\ Payments_t) )$: Present value of floating payments at time $( t )$.
- $( r_t )$: Discount rate for time $( t )$.
- $( Notional )$: Notional principal amount of the swap.
- $( n )$: Total number of payment periods.

### 2. Swap Valuation under Rate Changes
**Problem:** Model the effect of a 50 basis point increase in floating rates on the value of an interest rate swap, assuming initial fixed and floating rates.

**Solution:**  
When floating rates increase, the value of a swap can be recalculated by adjusting the floating rate. The new value $( V )$ of the swap can be determined as:

$[V_{new} = \sum_{t=1}^{n} \left( \frac{Fixed\ Rate \cdot Notional}{(1 + new\ Floating\ Rate_t)^t} - \frac{new\ Floating\ Rate_t \cdot Notional}{(1 + Floating\ Rate_t)^t} \right)]$

Where:
- $( new\ Floating\ Rate_t = Floating\ Rate_t + 0.005 )$ (50 basis points).

---

### 3. Notional Principal Adjustment
**Problem:** Analyze how changing the notional principal affects the value of an interest rate swap when the floating rate increases.

**Solution:**  
The value of an interest rate swap is directly proportional to the notional principal. If the notional principal increases, the cash flows (both fixed and floating) increase. The formula to determine the new value of the swap after adjusting the notional principal $( N )$ is:

$[V_{new} = N \times \sum_{t=1}^{n} \left( \frac{Fixed\ Rate - new\ Floating\ Rate_t}{(1 + Floating\ Rate_t)^t} \right)]$

---

### 4. Fixed vs. Floating Spread Analysis
**Problem:** Calculate the impact on the swap value if the spread between the fixed and floating rates widens or narrows.

**Solution:**  
To analyze the impact, we can define the spread $( S )$ as $( Fixed\ Rate - Floating\ Rate )$. The change in swap value can be estimated as:

$[\Delta V = Notional \times \sum_{t=1}^{n} \left( \frac{(Fixed\ Rate + \Delta S) - Floating\ Rate}{(1 + Floating\ Rate)^t} - \frac{Fixed\ Rate - (Floating\ Rate + \Delta S)}{(1 + Floating\ Rate)^t} \right)]$

Where $( \Delta S )$ is the change in the spread.

### 5. Swap Curve Construction
**Problem:** Construct a swap curve using market data for interest rate swaps with different maturities and use it to price a new swap contract.

**Solution:**  
1. **Collect market data** on swap rates for different maturities.
2. **Construct the swap curve** by plotting the maturities against their corresponding rates and using interpolation techniques (e.g., linear interpolation or cubic spline) to fill in gaps.
3. **Price a new swap contract** using the constructed curve:

$[Price_{new\ swap} = \sum_{t=1}^{n} \left( \frac{Fixed\ Rate \cdot Notional}{(1 + Swap\ Rate_t)^t} - \frac{Floating\ Rate \cdot Notional}{(1 + Swap\ Rate_t)^t} \right)]$

---

### 6. Swap Spread Risk
**Problem:** Evaluate the risk associated with changes in the swap spread for a company using interest rate swaps to hedge its exposure.

**Solution:**  
The risk associated with swap spread changes can be assessed by examining the duration and convexity of the swap:

1. **Calculate Duration** to assess sensitivity to spread changes:

$[Duration = \frac{\sum_{t=1}^{n} t \times \frac{Cash Flow_t}{(1 + Swap\ Rate)^t}}{ \sum_{t=1}^{n} \frac{Cash Flow_t}{(1 + Swap\ Rate)^t}}]$

2. **Assess Risk Exposure** by evaluating the potential change in value due to spread movements:

$[\Delta V = -Duration \times \Delta S \times Value_{swap}]$

Where $( \Delta S )$ is the change in spread.

---

### 7. Forward Swaps
**Problem:** Calculate the fair value of a forward swap agreement based on expected future interest rates and current market conditions.

**Solution:**  
The fair value $( FV )$ of a forward swap can be computed using the expected future interest rates $( r_{t+1} )$ at the forward start date:

$[FV = \sum_{t=1}^{n} \left( \frac{Fixed\ Rate \cdot Notional}{(1 + r_{t+1})^t} - \frac{Expected\ Floating\ Rate_t \cdot Notional}{(1 + r_{t+1})^t} \right)]$

---

### 8. Swaption Sensitivity
**Problem:** Assess the sensitivity of an interest rate swap’s value to changes in the volatility of the floating rate using a swaption.

**Solution:**  
The sensitivity can be determined using the Vega of the swaption, which measures how the value of the swap changes with changes in volatility:

$[\Delta V_{swaption} = Vega \times \Delta Volatility]$

Where Vega can be estimated using option pricing models (e.g., Black-Scholes).

---

### 9. Swap Term Structure

**Solution:**  
1. **Collect term structure data** (spot rates or forward rates).
2. **Calculate the present value** of cash flows considering the irregular payment intervals:

$[PV = \sum_{i=1}^{m} \frac{Cash Flow_i}{(1 + r_i)^{t_i}}]$

Where $( Cash Flow_i )$ represents the cash flows at the irregular intervals $( t_i )$ and $( r_i )$ are the corresponding discount rates.

---

### 10. Payment Frequency Impact
**Problem:** Analyze how changing the payment frequency (e.g., from semi-annual to annual) affects the valuation of an interest rate swap.

**Solution:**  
Changing the payment frequency affects the present value calculations, as cash flows occur more or less frequently:

$[V_{new} = \sum_{j=1}^{n'} \frac{Cash Flow_j}{(1 + new\ Rate_j)^{t_j}}]$

Where $( n' )$ is the number of new payment intervals (e.g., annual payments lead to fewer periods). The effective annual rate can also be adjusted to reflect the new frequency:

$[Effective\ Annual\ Rate = (1 + \frac{Rate}{m})^m - 1]$

Where $( m )$ is the number of payments per year.
