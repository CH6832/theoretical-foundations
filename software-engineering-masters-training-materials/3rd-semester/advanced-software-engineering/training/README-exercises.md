### **1. Advanced Software Development Methodologies**

#### **Agile and Scrum Advanced Practices**
1. **Scaling Agile**: Your company has 5 Scrum teams working on different components of a single product. Create a strategy to implement SAFe (Scaled Agile Framework) for coordination between teams. Identify challenges and propose solutions for cross-team dependencies.
2. **Custom Scrum Role Implementation**: Design a custom role (beyond Product Owner and Scrum Master) to improve communication between distributed Scrum teams. Document the responsibilities and how this role would interact with other Scrum roles.

#### **Lean Software Development**
3. **Kanban Workflow Optimization**: Implement a Kanban board using an online tool (e.g., Trello or Jira) for a software project. Track tasks, identify bottlenecks, and propose ways to reduce cycle time.
4. **Value Stream Mapping**: Analyze your team’s current software development process by creating a value stream map. Identify wasteful steps and suggest improvements to streamline development, reduce delays, and improve efficiency.

#### **Extreme Programming (XP)**
5. **Pair Programming Simulation**: Conduct a pair programming session using an online coding platform (e.g., Replit). Write tests for an existing codebase, and reflect on the benefits and challenges encountered during the session.
6. **Test-Driven Development**: Develop a small feature (e.g., user login or item checkout) in Java using Test-Driven Development. Ensure that all code is covered by unit tests and refactor to simplify the code while maintaining test coverage.

### **2. Software Engineering for Large Systems**

#### **Scalability Issues**
7. **Load Balancing Implementation**: Simulate high traffic by developing a Java web application and deploy it behind a load balancer (e.g., Nginx or AWS Elastic Load Balancing). Measure performance improvements compared to a single server deployment.
8. **Database Sharding**: Design a database sharding strategy for an e-commerce website that expects to handle millions of transactions per day. Justify the partitioning method (e.g., range-based, hash-based) and describe how you would handle shard failures.

#### **Performance Tuning**
9. **Java Profiling**: Take an existing Java project and use tools like VisualVM or JProfiler to profile its memory and CPU usage. Identify the bottlenecks and optimize the code for better performance.
10. **Caching Implementation**: Implement Redis as a cache layer in a Java web application to reduce database load. Measure performance before and after adding caching, and describe the scenarios where caching provided the most benefit.

#### **High Availability Systems**
11. **Designing for Failover**: Create a failover architecture for a critical service using two servers and a database replication mechanism. Implement a health-checking script in Java that detects server failure and switches the application to the backup server.
12. **Service Discovery**: Develop a Java-based microservices architecture using Consul or Eureka for service discovery. Simulate adding and removing services dynamically and observe how the service registry updates.

### **3. Software Process Improvement**

#### **Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI)**
13. **CMMI Process Assessment**: Assess the current software development process in your organization using the CMMI framework. Identify which maturity level the organization is at, and create a roadmap to advance to the next level.
14. **Process Improvement Project**: Implement a process improvement initiative in your team based on a CMMI assessment. Focus on improving a specific area like defect tracking, requirement gathering, or team communication. Measure the effectiveness of the improvement.

#### **Six Sigma in Software Engineering**
15. **Six Sigma Project in Defect Reduction**: Implement a Six Sigma DMAIC (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control) project to reduce defects in your software development process. Define measurable goals, analyze root causes of defects, and implement a solution that improves quality.
16. **Quality Improvement Using Lean Six Sigma**: Combine Lean and Six Sigma principles to identify inefficiencies in a software delivery pipeline. Implement small iterative improvements and evaluate the impact on development cycle time and software quality.

### **4. Emerging Technologies**

#### **Microservices Architecture**
17. **Microservices Decomposition**: Break down a monolithic Java application into microservices. Identify which parts of the application can be independent services, and outline how the services will communicate using REST APIs.
18. **Circuit Breaker Pattern**: Implement the circuit breaker pattern in a microservices architecture using Java and Spring Boot. Simulate a service failure and demonstrate how the circuit breaker prevents cascading failures in the system.

#### **Serverless Computing**
19. **AWS Lambda Function Deployment**: Write and deploy a serverless Java function on AWS Lambda that processes uploaded files in an S3 bucket. Measure the function’s execution time and explore options to optimize it for speed and cost.
20. **Event-Driven Architecture with Serverless**: Design an event-driven architecture using AWS Lambda, SQS (Simple Queue Service), and a database. Trigger the Lambda function when a new event arrives in the queue, and store the result in the database.

#### **Edge Computing**
21. **Edge Computing Simulation**: Develop a simple IoT application using Raspberry Pi or a similar device. Process the data on the edge (e.g., temperature sensor readings) and send only the necessary data to the cloud for further processing.
22. **Latency Analysis in Edge Computing**: Implement a Java program that processes video frames at the edge and sends results to a server. Measure latency reduction compared to processing all frames on the server.

### **5. Ethical and Legal Issues in Software Engineering**

#### **Intellectual Property Rights**
23. **Open Source Software Contribution**: Contribute to an open-source project. Analyze the project’s license (e.g., MIT, GPL) and explain how the license impacts your contribution and potential usage of the software.
24. **Software Patent Research**: Research a recent software patent related to AI or cloud computing. Discuss its implications on future software development in that domain and whether you believe it hinders or encourages innovation.

#### **Software Licensing**
25. **Choosing a Software License**: You are building a new open-source project in Java. Compare and select an appropriate license (e.g., MIT, Apache, GPL) for your project. Justify your decision based on project goals, future contributions, and commercial use.
26. **License Compliance in Enterprise Software**: As part of a software engineering team in an enterprise, audit an open-source Java project for license compliance. Ensure that the project complies with licenses like GPL, and propose steps to ensure future compliance.

#### **Ethical Considerations**
27. **Addressing Privacy Concerns**: Design a feature in a Java application that allows users to export or delete their personal data, ensuring GDPR compliance. Discuss the ethical considerations around data ownership and user privacy.
28. **Ethical Decision-Making Simulation**: You are part of a team that has been asked to implement a user tracking feature in a Java-based product. Discuss the ethical implications and potential risks of this feature, and propose an alternative approach that balances business goals with user privacy.

### **6. Large-Scale Software Project**
29. **Microservices-based E-Commerce Platform**: Design and implement a large-scale e-commerce system using microservices architecture. Use Java with Spring Boot for services like user authentication, product catalog, order processing, and payment handling. Integrate services with message queues for inter-service communication.
30. **Process Improvement Plan for an Organization**: Evaluate a company’s current software engineering practices, and develop a detailed process improvement plan based on methodologies like CMMI, Agile, and Six Sigma. Present recommendations for scaling, quality improvement, and efficiency enhancement.
