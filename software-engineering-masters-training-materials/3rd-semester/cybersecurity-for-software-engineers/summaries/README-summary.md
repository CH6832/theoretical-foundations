# Cybersecurity for Software Engineers: Expanded Learning Content

### **Module 1: Introduction to Cybersecurity**

**Learning Objectives:**
- Understand core security principles: Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability (CIA triad).
- Recognize various types of threats and vulnerabilities in software systems.

**Key Topics:**
1. **Security Fundamentals**  
   - **Confidentiality**: Ensure that sensitive data is only accessible to authorized users.
   - **Integrity**: Prevent unauthorized modification of data. Integrity ensures that the information is accurate and trustworthy.
   - **Availability**: Ensure systems and data are available when needed, avoiding downtime due to attacks or failures.
   
   **Example:**
   Think of a bank account. **Confidentiality** ensures only the account holder sees the balance, **integrity** ensures transactions are processed correctly, and **availability** makes sure users can access the system whenever they need to.

2. **Threats and Vulnerabilities**  
   - A **threat** is any potential danger to information (e.g., a hacker trying to access your database).
   - A **vulnerability** is a weakness in the system that can be exploited by a threat (e.g., unpatched software).
   
   **Common vulnerabilities include:**
   - **Buffer overflow**: When data overflows the allocated memory buffer, potentially leading to execution of malicious code.
   - **SQL Injection**: Manipulating SQL queries to execute unintended commands.

**Activities:**
- **Research Assignment**: Identify and analyze real-world cybersecurity breaches (e.g., Equifax breach) to understand what vulnerabilities were exploited.

### **Module 2: Secure Coding Practices**

**Learning Objectives:**
- Develop secure coding habits to prevent vulnerabilities.
- Understand the OWASP Top Ten list of most critical security risks.

**Key Topics:**
1. **Common Vulnerabilities (OWASP Top Ten)**  
   - **Injection Attacks (SQL Injection)**: Attackers insert malicious SQL code into queries.
   
     **Example in Python:**
     ```python
     import sqlite3
     
     # Vulnerable code (SQL Injection risk)
     user_input = "' OR '1'='1"
     query = f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '{user_input}'"
     
     # This would allow attackers to bypass authentication
     ```
     **Mitigation**:
     Use parameterized queries to avoid SQL injection.
     ```python
     conn = sqlite3.connect('example.db')
     cursor = conn.cursor()
     
     # Secure code (Parameterized query)
     user_input = 'admin'
     query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ?"
     cursor.execute(query, (user_input,))
     ```

   - **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: Injecting malicious scripts into web applications to steal user information or hijack sessions.
   - **Broken Authentication**: Poor implementation of authentication allows attackers to bypass login systems.

2. **Secure Coding Guidelines**  
   - **Input Validation**: Always sanitize user inputs. Never trust external inputs.
   - **Principle of Least Privilege**: Grant only the minimum privileges necessary for a task.
   - **Error Handling**: Avoid exposing sensitive system details in error messages.

**Activities:**
- **Hands-On Lab**: Identify and fix security vulnerabilities in sample code (e.g., SQL Injection, XSS).

### **Module 3: Cryptography**

**Learning Objectives:**
- Understand the basics of cryptographic algorithms.
- Use encryption to secure sensitive information.

**Key Topics:**
1. **Symmetric and Asymmetric Encryption**  
   - **Symmetric Encryption**: Uses the same key for both encryption and decryption (e.g., AES).
   
     **Example in Python (Symmetric Encryption using AES):**
     ```python
     from Crypto.Cipher import AES
     from Crypto.Random import get_random_bytes
     
     key = get_random_bytes(16)  # AES-128 key
     cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_EAX)
     data = b"Sensitive data"
     ciphertext, tag = cipher.encrypt_and_digest(data)
     
     print(f"Ciphertext: {ciphertext}")
     ```
   
   - **Asymmetric Encryption**: Uses a pair of keys – public key for encryption, private key for decryption (e.g., RSA).
   
     **Example in Python (Asymmetric Encryption using RSA):**
     ```python
     from Crypto.PublicKey import RSA
     from Crypto.Cipher import PKCS1_OAEP
     
     key = RSA.generate(2048)
     public_key = key.publickey()
     
     # Encrypt with public key
     cipher = PKCS1_OAEP.new(public_key)
     ciphertext = cipher.encrypt(b"Secret Message")
     
     # Decrypt with private key
     cipher = PKCS1_OAEP.new(key)
     plaintext = cipher.decrypt(ciphertext)
     
     print(f"Decrypted message: {plaintext}")
     ```

2. **Hashing and Digital Signatures**  
   - **Hashing**: A one-way function that transforms data into a fixed-size hash value (e.g., SHA-256).
   
     **Example in Python (Hashing with SHA-256):**
     ```python
     import hashlib
     
     message = b"Important Data"
     hash_object = hashlib.sha256(message)
     print(f"SHA-256 Hash: {hash_object.hexdigest()}")
     ```
   - **Digital Signatures**: Ensure authenticity and integrity by allowing verification that the data was signed by the private key holder.

3. **Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)**  
   - PKI helps secure communications via certificates and manages public keys for encryption.
   - Certificates are issued by trusted certificate authorities (CAs).

**Activities:**
- **Exercise**: Implement an encryption and decryption flow for a secure messaging system using both symmetric and asymmetric encryption.

### **Module 4: Network Security**

**Learning Objectives:**
- Secure network communications using appropriate tools and protocols.
- Defend against network-based attacks using firewalls, VPNs, and intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS).

**Key Topics:**
1. **Firewalls and VPNs**  
   - **Firewalls**: Filters incoming and outgoing network traffic based on security rules.
   - **VPNs**: Encrypts data over public networks to ensure confidentiality during transmission.

   **Example of Using a Firewall Rule (Linux `iptables` command):**
   ```bash
   sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT
   ```

2. **Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS)**  
   - **IDS**: Monitors network traffic and alerts when suspicious activity is detected (e.g., Snort).
   - **IPS**: Automatically takes action to block or prevent malicious activities.

**Activities:**
- **Practical Exercise**: Configure a basic firewall to block unauthorized traffic. Set up a VPN for a remote connection.
- **IDS/IPS Lab**: Simulate a network attack and use an IDS like Snort to detect it.

### **Module 5: Security Testing and Auditing**

**Learning Objectives:**
- Perform penetration testing to find vulnerabilities.
- Understand the importance of regular security audits and ensuring compliance with industry standards.

**Key Topics:**
1. **Penetration Testing**  
   - Ethical hacking to simulate attacks and identify vulnerabilities before they are exploited.
   - Techniques include vulnerability scanning, exploiting weaknesses, and reporting findings.
   
     **Common Tools:**
     - **Metasploit**: Framework for penetration testing and exploitation.
     - **Burp Suite**: Tool for web application security testing.

2. **Security Audits and Compliance**  
   - Regularly auditing systems for security vulnerabilities.
   - Ensuring compliance with industry standards like **GDPR** (data protection), **HIPAA** (health information security), and **ISO/IEC 27001** (information security management).

**Activities:**
- **Penetration Testing Lab**: Use tools like Metasploit to conduct penetration testing on a vulnerable web application.
- **Security Audit Project**: Perform an audit on a mock organization’s IT infrastructure and suggest improvements based on compliance standards.
