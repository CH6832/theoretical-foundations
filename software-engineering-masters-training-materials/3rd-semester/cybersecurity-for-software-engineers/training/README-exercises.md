### **1. Introduction to Cybersecurity**

#### **Security Fundamentals**
1. **Threat Modeling**: Analyzing a software application to identify potential threats and vulnerabilities helps in proactively addressing security concerns, which is crucial in real-world software development.

### **2. Secure Coding Practices**

#### **Common Vulnerabilities**
2. **Prevent SQL Injection in Python**: Using parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks mirrors best practices for protecting databases in real-world applications.
3. **Secure String Handling in C++**: Demonstrates safe string handling to prevent buffer overflow vulnerabilities, a common issue in C++ programming.

#### **Secure Coding Guidelines**
4. **Conduct Secure Coding Review**: Reviewing and improving a codebase for security issues reflects real-world practices where security reviews are integral to maintaining secure software.

### **3. Cryptography**

#### **Symmetric and Asymmetric Encryption**
5. **Encrypt and Decrypt Data in Python**: Using symmetric encryption with the `cryptography` library shows how to protect data in transit or at rest, a common requirement in secure applications.
6. **RSA Encryption in C++**: Generating RSA key pairs demonstrates how public and private keys are used for secure communication and data protection.

#### **Hashing and Digital Signatures**
7. **Hash Message with SHA-256 in Python**: Hashing data ensures integrity and is a common practice in digital security to verify data authenticity.
8. **SHA-256 Hashing in C++**: Demonstrates practical implementation of hashing algorithms for ensuring data integrity.

#### **Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)**
9. **Set Up a PKI System**: Managing digital certificates reflects real-world practices for securing communications and verifying identities through certificate authorities.

### **4. Network Security**

#### **Firewalls and VPNs**
10. **Implement Firewall Rule in Python**: Demonstrates basic firewall functionality, useful for filtering and controlling network traffic, a real-world necessity for network security.
11. **Understand VPNs**: Securing communication over public networks is essential for protecting data in transit.

#### **Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS)**
12. **Develop Basic IDS**: Building a simple IDS to detect suspicious network activity mirrors real-world practices for monitoring and responding to security threats.

### **5. Security Testing and Auditing**

#### **Penetration Testing**
13. **Network Scanning with Scapy**: Using Scapy for network scanning reflects real-world penetration testing activities to discover vulnerabilities in network services.
14. **Penetration Testing Methodologies**: Applying PenTest methodologies and tools such as Metasploit and Burp Suite helps in identifying and addressing security weaknesses.

#### **Security Audits and Compliance**
15. **Conduct a Security Audit**: Performing a comprehensive security audit of a software application reflects real-world practices for assessing and ensuring application security.
16. **Understand Compliance Standards**: Reviewing compliance with standards like GDPR and HIPAA is crucial for meeting legal and regulatory requirements.

### **General**

17. **Security Assessment Project**: Designing and implementing a security assessment project helps apply theoretical knowledge to practical scenarios, reflecting real-world responsibilities in cybersecurity.
18. **Penetration Testing Exercises**: Conducting penetration tests and reporting findings simulate real-world security assessments and vulnerability management.
