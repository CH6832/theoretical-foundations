## Course Content

### **1. Introduction to Blockchain**

#### **Blockchain Fundamentals**
- **Blockchain Architecture**: 
  - **Blocks**: Data structures containing transaction details.
  - **Chains**: Linked sequence of blocks secured through cryptographic hashes.
  - **Nodes**: Participants in the network that validate and propagate transactions.
  - **Transactions**: Basic units of value transfer on the blockchain.

- **Blockchain Types**: 
  - **Public Blockchains**: Open for anyone to participate (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum).
  - **Private Blockchains**: Restricted access, suitable for enterprises (e.g., Hyperledger).
  - **Consortium Blockchains**: Governed by a group of organizations, balancing privacy and collaboration.

**Real-World Example:**
- **Creating a Basic Blockchain**: Build a simple blockchain from scratch to understand its structure and functionality.

**Code Example (Pseudocode):**
```pseudocode
class Blockchain:
    Initialize:
        chain = empty list
        current_transactions = empty list
        Create genesis block

    Function new_block(proof, previous_hash):
        block = {
            'index': length(chain) + 1,
            'timestamp': current_time(),
            'transactions': current_transactions,
            'proof': proof,
            'previous_hash': previous_hash or hash(last block),
        }
        current_transactions = empty list
        append block to chain
        return block

    Function hash(block):
        block_string = serialize(block)
        return SHA256(block_string)

    Function proof_of_work(last_proof):
        proof = 0
        while not valid_proof(last_proof, proof):
            proof += 1
        return proof

    Function valid_proof(last_proof, proof):
        guess = concatenate(last_proof, proof)
        guess_hash = SHA256(guess)
        return guess_hash starts with "0000"
```

#### **Consensus Mechanisms**
- **Proof of Work (PoW)**: A mechanism where miners solve complex puzzles to validate transactions, impacting energy consumption.
- **Proof of Stake (PoS)**: Validators are chosen based on the number of coins they hold and are willing to "stake."
- **Other Mechanisms**: Explore alternatives like Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) and Proof of Authority (PoA).

**Real-World Example:**
- **Comparing Consensus Mechanisms**: Analyze the strengths and weaknesses of PoW versus PoS in various blockchain applications.

**Code Example (Pseudocode):**
```pseudocode
last_proof = 100
blockchain = new Blockchain()
proof = blockchain.proof_of_work(last_proof)
print("Proof found:", proof)
```

### **2. Cryptographic Foundations**

#### **Hash Functions**
- **SHA-256**: A secure hashing algorithm essential for Bitcoinâ€™s blockchain, ensuring data integrity.
- **Hashing for Integrity**: Utilized to verify that transaction data has not been altered.

**Real-World Example:**
- **Implementing SHA-256 Hashing**: Use hashing to secure data and verify the integrity of blockchain transactions.

**Code Example (Pseudocode):**
```pseudocode
Function hash_data(data):
    return SHA256(data)
```

#### **Digital Signatures**
- **Public and Private Keys**: Utilized to sign transactions, ensuring authenticity and non-repudiation.
- **Verification**: The process of validating a signature using a public key.

**Real-World Example:**
- **Generating and Verifying Digital Signatures**: Implement signing and verification techniques to secure blockchain transactions.

**Code Example (Pseudocode):**
```pseudocode
Generate private_key
public_key = derive from private_key

message = "Blockchain transaction"
signature = sign(message, private_key)

is_valid = verify(signature, message, public_key)
```

#### **Merkle Trees**
- **Structure and Function**: A hash-based data structure that allows efficient verification of data integrity.
- **Merkle Roots**: A single hash that represents all transactions in a block.

**Real-World Example:**
- **Building a Merkle Tree**: Use Merkle Trees to optimize data verification processes within a blockchain.

**Code Example (Pseudocode):**
```pseudocode
Function merkle_root(hashes):
    If length(hashes) is odd:
        append last hash to hashes
    While length(hashes) > 1:
        hashes = new list of SHA256(concatenate(hashes[i], hashes[i + 1])) for i in range(0, length(hashes), 2)
    return hashes[0]
```

### **3. Smart Contracts and DApps**

#### **Ethereum and Solidity**
- **Ethereum Basics**: A decentralized platform that enables the execution of smart contracts and the development of decentralized applications (DApps).
- **Solidity Language**: A statically-typed programming language used for writing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.

**Real-World Example:**
- **Developing a Token Contract**: Create a simple ERC-20 token contract on Ethereum.

**Code Example (Pseudocode):**
```solidity
contract SimpleToken {
    string public name = "SimpleToken";
    string public symbol = "STK";
    uint8 public decimals = 18;
    uint public totalSupply;

    constructor(uint initialSupply) {
        totalSupply = initialSupply * 10^decimals
        balanceOf[msg.sender] = totalSupply
    }

    function transfer(address to, uint value) {
        require(balanceOf[msg.sender] >= value)
        balanceOf[msg.sender] -= value
        balanceOf[to] += value
    }
}
```

#### **Smart Contract Development**

const SimpleToken = artifacts.require("SimpleToken");

module.exports = function (deployer) {
  deployer.deploy(SimpleToken, 1000000); // Initial supply
};
```

#### **Decentralized Applications (DApps)**
