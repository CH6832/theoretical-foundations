### **1. Introduction to Machine Learning**

#### Exercise 1: **Classification Model (Supervised Learning)**
- **Task**: Implement a classification model using Scikit-learn on the Titanic dataset. Preprocess the data (handle missing values, encode categorical variables), train a model (Logistic Regression or Decision Tree), and evaluate the accuracy.
  
#### Exercise 2: **Regression Model (Supervised Learning)**
- **Task**: Build a regression model to predict house prices using the Boston Housing dataset. Evaluate the performance using mean squared error (MSE) and visualize the model's predictions versus actual values.
  
#### Exercise 3: **K-Means Clustering (Unsupervised Learning)**
- **Task**: Apply K-Means clustering to the Iris dataset. Visualize the clustering results, and evaluate how well the model grouped the different species of flowers.
  
#### Exercise 4: **Dimensionality Reduction with PCA (Unsupervised Learning)**
- **Task**: Use Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on a high-dimensional dataset (e.g., Wine dataset). Reduce it to 2D and plot the result. Analyze how much variance is captured by the first two principal components.

### **2. Model Building**

#### Exercise 5: **Feature Engineering**
- **Task**: Given a time-series dataset (e.g., stock prices), extract relevant features like moving averages, daily returns, and date-based features (weekday, month). Use these features to train a machine learning model to predict future stock prices.

#### Exercise 6: **Feature Selection with Correlation Matrix**
- **Task**: Use a dataset of your choice (e.g., Medical or Retail dataset) and calculate the correlation matrix between features. Select the top correlated features for model building and evaluate the performance impact compared to using all features.

#### Exercise 7: **Model Selection with Cross-Validation**
- **Task**: Implement K-fold cross-validation on a classification dataset (e.g., Breast Cancer dataset) using multiple models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest). Compare their performance based on accuracy and select the best model.

#### Exercise 8: **Hyperparameter Tuning with Grid Search**
- **Task**: Use GridSearchCV to tune hyperparameters of a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model on a classification dataset (e.g., Iris dataset). Identify the best parameters and evaluate the modelâ€™s performance.

### **3. Algorithms and Techniques**

#### Exercise 9: **Linear Regression**
- **Task**: Build a Linear Regression model to predict car prices based on their features (e.g., horsepower, engine size, weight). Visualize the relationship between predicted and actual prices. Use performance metrics like R-squared and MSE.

#### Exercise 10: **Logistic Regression for Classification**
- **Task**: Use Logistic Regression to predict whether a customer will purchase a product based on demographic features (age, income, gender). Analyze the model's coefficients to interpret how each feature affects the purchase decision.

#### Exercise 11: **Decision Tree Classifier**
- **Task**: Implement a Decision Tree Classifier on the Titanic dataset. Visualize the tree structure and analyze the importance of different features. Compare the accuracy with and without feature engineering.

#### Exercise 12: **Random Forest Classifier**
- **Task**: Train a Random Forest model on a classification dataset (e.g., MNIST for digit recognition). Evaluate feature importance and compare the model's accuracy with a single decision tree classifier.

#### Exercise 13: **Gradient Boosting for Regression**
- **Task**: Use Gradient Boosting (e.g., XGBoost or Scikit-learn's GradientBoostingRegressor) to predict house prices. Compare the performance of Gradient Boosting with a simpler model like Linear Regression.

#### Exercise 14: **Neural Network with TensorFlow**
- **Task**: Build a simple neural network using TensorFlow to classify images from the MNIST dataset. Evaluate the accuracy on both training and test data, and visualize training history (loss and accuracy over epochs).

#### Exercise 15: **PyTorch Neural Network**
- **Task**: Use PyTorch to build and train a neural network for image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset. Implement techniques like dropout to improve generalization. Visualize the training loss and accuracy.

### **4. Machine Learning Tools and Frameworks**

#### Exercise 16: **Pipeline with Scikit-learn**
- **Task**: Create a Scikit-learn pipeline that standardizes the features, applies PCA for dimensionality reduction, and trains an SVM classifier. Apply the pipeline to a classification dataset (e.g., Wine dataset) and evaluate the results.

#### Exercise 17: **TensorFlow for Regression**
- **Task**: Implement a regression model in TensorFlow to predict house prices. Use multiple dense layers and ReLU activations. Evaluate the model's performance using MSE and plot the learning curves.

#### Exercise 18: **Model Deployment with Flask**
- **Task**: Train a Random Forest classifier on the Iris dataset, save the model using `joblib`, and create a Flask API to serve predictions. Test the API by sending requests with flower measurements and receiving predictions.

#### Exercise 19: **Monitoring Model Performance**
- **Task**: Create a pipeline for model deployment where you monitor its performance over time. Use a logging library to track prediction accuracy and errors in a file. Periodically evaluate the model to ensure its predictions remain reliable.

### **5. Ethics and Bias in Machine Learning**

#### Exercise 20: **Bias Detection and Mitigation**
- **Task**: Use the German Credit dataset (or any dataset containing sensitive attributes like gender or race). Train a classifier to predict credit approval. Analyze the bias using fairness metrics (e.g., disparate impact). Apply re-weighting or other techniques to mitigate bias and compare performance.
