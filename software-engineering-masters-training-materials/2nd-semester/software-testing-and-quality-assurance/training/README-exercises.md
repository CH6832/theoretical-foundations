## Course Content

### **1. Introduction to Software Testing**

#### **Testing Fundamentals**
1. **Unit Testing in Python**: Write unit tests for a custom Python function that parses configuration files (e.g., `.json` or `.yaml`). Ensure edge cases such as missing keys or invalid file formats are handled. This simulates testing configuration parsing in real-world applications.
2. **Unit Testing in Java**: Develop a Java method that handles API responses, and create a JUnit test for both successful responses and error cases (e.g., 404, 500 errors). This is common in microservices or web-based systems.
3. **Create a Real-world Test Plan**: Create a test plan for the rollout of a mobile app update. Include user stories, risk analysis (e.g., backward compatibility issues), test scenarios, cases, and metrics. Plan how you'd handle testing on multiple OS versions (Android/iOS).
4. **Integration Testing in Python**: Write integration tests for a microservices architecture, ensuring that service communication via RESTful APIs functions correctly. This will mimic a real-world scenario where different services depend on each other.
5. **Integration Testing in Java**: Develop a set of integration tests for a Spring Boot application, testing the interactions between different layers (controllers, services, repositories) and ensuring that the application responds correctly to various HTTP requests.
6. **Exploratory Testing**: Conduct exploratory testing on a new web application feature. Document the process, findings, and any bugs discovered, simulating real-world testing scenarios where structured tests may not cover all functionalities.

### **2. Testing Techniques**
7. **Black-box Testing in Python**: Test a web application's user registration feature using a black-box testing approach. Focus on invalid input handling (e.g., password strength, invalid email formats) using property-based testing (`hypothesis`).
8. **Black-box Testing in Java**: Perform black-box testing on a login feature, evaluating various login scenarios including valid and invalid credentials, and session timeout.
9. **White-box Testing in Python**: Write tests for a Python script that processes large datasets from a CSV file. Ensure internal logic, such as conditional filtering and transformations, are thoroughly tested. Use code coverage tools to ensure high branch coverage.
10. **White-box Testing in Java**: Implement white-box tests for a complex algorithm in a Java application, ensuring that all branches of the algorithm are executed and verified.
11. **Performance Testing in Python**: Write a scalable web service using Flask that interacts with a database. Use `locust` to simulate thousands of users making concurrent requests, and analyze response times, scalability, and bottlenecks. This mirrors real-world load testing scenarios for web services.
12. **Performance Testing in Java**: Create a Java application that generates a large dataset and use JMH to benchmark the performance of data processing algorithms, identifying bottlenecks and optimizing the code accordingly.

### **3. Regression Testing and Performance Testing**
13. **Automated Regression Test Suite**: Take an open-source project or a web application and create a regression test suite using `pytest` or a similar tool. Simulate a common real-world scenario where the test suite is triggered automatically whenever the application’s main branch is updated.
14. **Conduct Performance Testing in Java**: Write a Java-based service (e.g., a REST API) and use JMH to benchmark its performance under different loads. Include real-world scenarios like simulating database access or external service calls under stress conditions.
15. **Build a Regression Testing Framework**: Design and implement a custom regression testing framework for a project in either Python or Java. Include various testing strategies, such as smoke tests, sanity tests, and functional tests.

### **4. Automated Testing**
16. **Selenium Web Automation in Python**: Automate an e-commerce checkout flow using Selenium in Python, from adding items to a cart to completing a purchase. Verify essential flows such as payment processing and error handling (e.g., invalid card details).
17. **Selenium TestNG Integration in Java**: Automate a Selenium test for user actions (e.g., adding comments or liking a post) on a social media platform. Ensure that the test can handle different screen resolutions and browsers to reflect a real-world scenario.
18. **CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions**: Build a Python microservice and create a CI/CD pipeline that runs tests on multiple Python versions. Add integration tests that verify interaction with a database, and automatically deploy to a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Heroku) on successful builds.
19. **CI/CD Pipeline with Jenkins**: Configure a Jenkins pipeline for a Java-based project, including stages for building, running integration tests, and deploying to a staging environment. Simulate deployment rollbacks if tests fail, which is common in continuous delivery pipelines.
20. **API Testing with Postman**: Use Postman to create automated tests for a REST API. Write tests to validate response structures, status codes, and error handling. Integrate these tests into a CI/CD pipeline for continuous testing.

### **5. Quality Assurance Practices**
21. **Code Complexity Analysis in Python**: Use `radon` to measure the complexity of a real-world Python project (e.g., a Django or Flask app). Identify and refactor the most complex parts of the codebase, prioritizing maintainability and ease of understanding.
22. **Static Analysis in Java**: Integrate SonarQube with a real-world Java project and analyze the codebase for bugs, vulnerabilities, and code smells. Simulate how you would incorporate SonarQube in a continuous integration environment for real-time code quality checks.
23. **Conduct Code Reviews**: Participate in a code review session for a peer's project. Provide feedback on code quality, potential bugs, and adherence to coding standards, simulating the collaborative nature of modern software development.

### **6. Bug Tracking and Management**
24. **Setup a Bug Tracking System**: Use Jira or a similar bug-tracking tool to manage issues for an ongoing project. Simulate working in a Scrum environment by tracking bugs as part of sprint planning, adding details like issue priority, estimated time to fix, and acceptance criteria for each bug.
25. **Create a Bug Reporting Template**: Develop a standardized bug reporting template for your team. Include sections for reproduction steps, expected vs. actual results, and screenshots, ensuring comprehensive documentation for efficient resolution.

### **7. Advanced Topics in Testing**
26. **Security Testing in Python**: Use `bandit` to scan a real-world Python web application (e.g., a Django app) for security vulnerabilities. Identify vulnerabilities such as hardcoded credentials, insecure HTTP connections, or SQL injections, and recommend fixes.
27. **Usability Testing on a Web Application**: Conduct a usability test for a real-world website (e.g., a news site, e-commerce platform). Gather real user feedback, analyze navigation efficiency, and suggest improvements based on common user pain points.
28. **Conduct Penetration Testing**: Use tools like OWASP ZAP or Burp Suite to conduct penetration testing on a web application. Document vulnerabilities discovered and recommend remediation strategies.

### **8. Test-Driven Development (TDD)**
29. **TDD in Python**: Write a feature for a REST API in Python that handles user authentication (sign-up, login, token generation). Follow TDD principles by writing tests for each feature (e.g., invalid credentials, session expiry) before implementation.
30. **TDD in Java**: Develop a Java microservice that processes user data (e.g., updating user profiles). Use TDD to build features like updating, deleting, and retrieving user details from a database, ensuring proper exception handling and validation.
31. **Refactor Existing Code with TDD**: Take an existing project and refactor a module using TDD principles. Write tests for the existing behavior, make changes, and ensure all tests pass, demonstrating how TDD can facilitate safer refactoring.

### **9. Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)**
32. **BDD with Cucumber in Java**: Implement BDD for an e-commerce platform’s product search feature. Write Cucumber feature files that describe scenarios like searching for products by name, filtering by price range, and sorting by customer reviews. Implement the step definitions in Java, simulating real-world user behavior and expectations.
33. **Create BDD Scenarios for a User Management System**: Develop BDD scenarios for a user management system. Focus on user registration, login, profile updates, and role-based access controls. Create accompanying step definitions to implement these scenarios in your testing framework.

### **10. Collaboration and Communication**
34. **Participate in Agile Ceremonies**: Engage in agile ceremonies such as sprint planning, daily stand-ups, and retrospectives. Document your contributions and insights, focusing on how testing fits into the overall development process.
35. **Effective Communication in QA**: Create a presentation on the importance of quality assurance and testing within a software development team. Present to your peers or stakeholders to enhance communication skills and share insights on best practices.

### **11. Additional Testing Tools and Frameworks**
36. **Exploring New Testing Tools**

: Research and explore a new testing tool or framework that could benefit your current projects (e.g., Cypress for end-to-end testing, Pytest for Python). Write a report on its features, advantages, and potential use cases.
37. **Custom Test Framework Development**: Develop a simple testing framework for either Python or Java that includes features for writing tests, running tests, and reporting results. This will deepen understanding of testing at a foundational level.

### **12. Continuous Learning and Improvement**
38. **Read and Summarize Testing Literature**: Choose a book or article on software testing and write a summary of its key points, discussing how it applies to current practices or your projects.
39. **Join a Testing Community**: Engage with online communities (e.g., forums, Slack groups, or local meetups) focused on software testing. Share your experiences and learn from others in the field.
