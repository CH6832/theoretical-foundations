### **1. Testing Fundamentals**
1. **Unit Testing in Python**: Write unit tests for a custom Python function that parses configuration files (e.g., `.json` or `.yaml`). Ensure edge cases such as missing keys or invalid file formats are handled. This simulates testing configuration parsing in real-world applications.
2. **Unit Testing in Java**: Develop a Java method that handles API responses, and create a JUnit test for both successful responses and error cases (e.g., 404, 500 errors). This is common in microservices or web-based systems.
3. **Create a Real-world Test Plan**: Create a test plan for the rollout of a mobile app update. Include user stories, risk analysis (e.g., backward compatibility issues), test scenarios, cases, and metrics. Plan how you'd handle testing on multiple OS versions (Android/iOS).

### **2. Testing Techniques**
4. **Black-box Testing in Python**: Test a web application's user registration feature using a black-box testing approach. Focus on invalid input handling (e.g., password strength, invalid email formats) using property-based testing (`hypothesis`).
5. **White-box Testing in Python**: Write tests for a Python script that processes large datasets from a CSV file. Ensure internal logic, such as conditional filtering and transformations, are thoroughly tested. Use code coverage tools to ensure high branch coverage.
6. **Performance Testing in Python**: Write a scalable web service using Flask that interacts with a database. Use `locust` to simulate thousands of users making concurrent requests, and analyze response times, scalability, and bottlenecks. This mirrors real-world load testing scenarios for web services.

### **3. Regression Testing and Performance Testing**
7. **Automated Regression Test Suite**: Take an open-source project or a web application and create a regression test suite using `pytest` or a similar tool. Simulate a common real-world scenario where the test suite is triggered automatically whenever the application’s main branch is updated.
8. **Conduct Performance Testing in Java**: Write a Java-based service (e.g., a REST API) and use JMH to benchmark its performance under different loads. Include real-world scenarios like simulating database access or external service calls under stress conditions.

### **4. Automated Testing**
9. **Selenium Web Automation in Python**: Automate an e-commerce checkout flow using Selenium in Python, from adding items to a cart to completing a purchase. Verify essential flows such as payment processing and error handling (e.g., invalid card details).
10. **Selenium TestNG Integration in Java**: Automate a Selenium test for user actions (e.g., adding comments or liking a post) on a social media platform. Ensure that the test can handle different screen resolutions and browsers to reflect a real-world scenario.
11. **CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions**: Build a Python microservice and create a CI/CD pipeline that runs tests on multiple Python versions. Add integration tests that verify interaction with a database, and automatically deploy to a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Heroku) on successful builds.
12. **CI/CD Pipeline with Jenkins**: Configure a Jenkins pipeline for a Java-based project, including stages for building, running integration tests, and deploying to a staging environment. Simulate deployment rollbacks if tests fail, which is common in continuous delivery pipelines.

### **5. Quality Assurance Practices**
13. **Code Complexity Analysis in Python**: Use `radon` to measure the complexity of a real-world Python project (e.g., a Django or Flask app). Identify and refactor the most complex parts of the codebase, prioritizing maintainability and ease of understanding.
14. **Static Analysis in Java**: Integrate SonarQube with a real-world Java project and analyze the codebase for bugs, vulnerabilities, and code smells. Simulate how you would incorporate SonarQube in a continuous integration environment for real-time code quality checks.

### **6. Bug Tracking and Management**
15. **Setup a Bug Tracking System**: Use Jira or a similar bug-tracking tool to manage issues for an ongoing project. Simulate working in a Scrum environment by tracking bugs as part of sprint planning, adding details like issue priority, estimated time to fix, and acceptance criteria for each bug.

### **7. Advanced Topics in Testing**
16. **Security Testing in Python**: Use `bandit` to scan a real-world Python web application (e.g., a Django app) for security vulnerabilities. Identify vulnerabilities such as hardcoded credentials, insecure HTTP connections, or SQL injections, and recommend fixes.
17. **Usability Testing on a Web Application**: Conduct a usability test for a real-world website (e.g., a news site, e-commerce platform). Gather real user feedback, analyze navigation efficiency, and suggest improvements based on common user pain points.

### **8. Test-Driven Development (TDD)**
18. **TDD in Python**: Write a feature for a REST API in Python that handles user authentication (sign-up, login, token generation). Follow TDD principles by writing tests for each feature (e.g., invalid credentials, session expiry) before implementation.
19. **TDD in Java**: Develop a Java microservice that processes user data (e.g., updating user profiles). Use TDD to build features like updating, deleting, and retrieving user details from a database, ensuring proper exception handling and validation.

### **9. Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)**
20. **BDD with Cucumber in Java**: Implement BDD for an e-commerce platform’s product search feature. Write Cucumber feature files that describe scenarios like searching for products by name, filtering by price range, and sorting by customer reviews. Implement the step definitions in Java, simulating real-world user behavior and expectations.

### Key Changes for Real-world Alignment:
1. **Practical Scenarios**: Instead of just focusing on theoretical knowledge, I’ve incorporated exercises that simulate real-world tasks like handling web services, interacting with APIs, and testing user authentication.
2. **Scalability and Performance**: Real-world testing often involves scalability, concurrency, and integration with external systems (databases, APIs). I’ve made sure exercises like performance testing and regression testing reflect this.
3. **Automation and CI/CD**: CI/CD pipelines, regression testing suites, and automated browser testing are common in modern software development. Exercises simulate how you would integrate testing with continuous delivery and deployment workflows.
4. **Security and Usability**: These areas are highly emphasized in modern QA. I’ve added exercises to scan codebases for vulnerabilities and test real-world applications for usability.
