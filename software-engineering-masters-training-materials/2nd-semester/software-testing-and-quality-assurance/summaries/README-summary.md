## Course Content

### **1. Introduction to Software Testing**

#### **Testing Fundamentals**
- **Unit Testing**: A fundamental practice in software development, unit testing focuses on testing individual components or functions in isolation to ensure that they work as intended. This practice helps catch bugs early in the development cycle, which is more cost-effective than finding them later.
  
- **Integration Testing**: This stage verifies that multiple components work together as expected. Integration testing helps identify issues related to data flow between modules, making it critical for ensuring that the combined functionality meets specifications.

**Python Example (Advanced Unit Testing with `pytest`):**
```python
# advanced_tests.py
import pytest

def divide(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        raise ValueError("Cannot divide by zero")
    return a / b

def test_divide():
    assert divide(6, 3) == 2
    with pytest.raises(ValueError):
        divide(6, 0)
```

**Java Example (Advanced Unit Testing with JUnit and Mockito):**
```java
import org.junit.Test;
import org.mockito.Mockito;

import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;
import static org.mockito.Mockito.*;

public class CalculatorTest {
    public int divide(int a, int b) {
        if (b == 0) throw new IllegalArgumentException("Cannot divide by zero");
        return a / b;
    }

    @Test
    public void testDivide() {
        Calculator calculator = new Calculator();
        assertEquals(2, calculator.divide(6, 3));
        try {
            calculator.divide(6, 0);
        } catch (IllegalArgumentException e) {
            assertEquals("Cannot divide by zero", e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

#### **Testing Lifecycle**
- **Test Planning**: Effective test planning is critical to successful software testing. It involves creating a detailed strategy that includes objectives, scope, resource allocation, timelines, and risk assessment.
  
- **Test Design**: This phase includes developing, reviewing, and refining test cases to ensure comprehensive coverage of the application's functionality and potential edge cases.
  
- **Test Execution**: Executing tests involves implementing the planned tests and documenting the results, including any defects found during the testing process.

- **Test Closure**: This final phase analyzes test results, compiles reports on issues encountered, and refines future testing processes to continuously improve the software development lifecycle.

**Practical Exercise:**
- **Create a Detailed Test Plan**: For a new feature, including objectives, scenarios, cases, and metrics. Participants will learn how to anticipate potential issues and develop a structured approach to testing.

### **2. Testing Techniques**

#### **Black-box Testing**
- **Definition**: Black-box testing focuses on the inputs and outputs of the software without knowledge of the internal code structure. This technique is vital for validating functional requirements.

**Python Example (Black-box Testing with Property-Based Testing using `hypothesis`):**
```python
# black_box_test.py
from hypothesis import given, strategies as st

def add(a, b):
    return a + b

@given(st.integers(), st.integers())
def test_add(a, b):
    assert add(a, b) == a + b
```

**Java Example (Black-box Testing with Randomized Testing using JUnit and QuickCheck):**
```java
import org.junit.Test;
import org.quicktheories.QuickTheory;

public class MathOperationsTest {
    @Test
    public void testAdd() {
        QuickTheory.qt()
            .forAll(arbIntegers(), arbIntegers())
            .check((a, b) -> add(a, b) == a + b);
    }
}
```

#### **White-box Testing**
- **Definition**: White-box testing requires knowledge of the internal code structure, logic, and algorithms. This technique is effective for verifying the internal workings of an application.

**Python Example (White-box Testing with Code Coverage and `coverage`):**
```python
# code.py
def is_positive(number):
    return number > 0

# test_code.py
import coverage

cov = coverage.Coverage()
cov.start()

# Run your tests
import test_code

cov.stop()
cov.save()
cov.report()
```

**Java Example (White-box Testing with Code Coverage using JaCoCo):**
```xml
<!-- pom.xml -->
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.jacoco</groupId>
    <artifactId>jacoco-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>0.8.7</version>
    <executions>
        <execution>
            <id>prepare-agent</id>
            <goals>
                <goal>prepare-agent</goal>
            </goals>
        </execution>
        <execution>
            <id>report</id>
            <phase>verify</phase>
            <goals>
                <goal>report</goal>
            </goals>
        </execution>
    </executions>
</plugin>
```

#### **Regression Testing and Performance Testing**
- **Regression Testing**: Automated regression test suites are crucial for ensuring that newly added features do not introduce defects into existing functionalities. This testing must be done frequently to maintain software quality throughout the development cycle.

- **Performance Testing**: Involves assessing how an application performs under various conditions, including load testing, stress testing, and benchmarking. Understanding performance helps in identifying bottlenecks and optimizing system responsiveness.

**Python Example (Performance Testing with `locust`):**
```python
# locustfile.py
from locust import HttpUser, task

class WebsiteUser(HttpUser):
    @task
    def index(self):
        self.client.get("/")
```

**Java Example (Performance Testing with JMH):**
```java
import org.openjdk.jmh.annotations.Benchmark;
import org.openjdk.jmh.annotations.State;
import org.openjdk.jmh.annotations.Scope;

@State(Scope.Thread)
public class PerformanceTest {
    @Benchmark
    public void testSort() {
        List<Integer> list = Arrays.asList(3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9);
        Collections.sort(list);
    }
}
```

**Practical Exercise:**
- **Implement a Regression Test Suite**: For a medium-sized project, students will create a comprehensive regression suite to identify any regressions in functionality.
- **Conduct Performance Testing**: Participants will analyze the performance impact of a feature or service, learning how to interpret the results to drive improvements.

### **3. Automated Testing**

#### **Test Frameworks and Tools**
- **JUnit**: A widely-used framework for unit testing in Java, enabling the execution of tests and reporting of results efficiently.
  
- **Selenium**: An essential tool for automated browser testing that allows for simulating user interactions with web applications.

**Python Example (Advanced Automated Testing with `pytest` and `selenium`):**
```python
# test_selenium.py
from selenium import webdriver

def test_google_search():
    driver = webdriver.Chrome()
    driver.get("https://www.google.com")
    assert "Google" in driver.title
    driver.quit()
```

**Java Example (Advanced Automated Testing with Selenium and TestNG):**
```xml
<!-- pom.xml -->
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.seleniumhq.selenium</groupId>
    <artifactId>selenium-java</artifactId>
    <version>4.0.0</version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.testng</groupId>
    <artifactId>testng</artifactId>
    <version>7.4.0</version>
</dependency>
```

```java
import org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver;
import org.openqa.selenium.chrome.ChromeDriver;
import org.testng.annotations.Test;

public class SeleniumTest {
    @Test
    public void testGoogleTitle() {
        WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();
        driver.get("https://www.google.com");
        assert driver.getTitle().contains("Google");
        driver.quit();
    }
}
```

#### **Continuous Integration and Delivery (CI/CD)**
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: These automated pipelines facilitate the integration of code changes and ensure that tests are executed every time new code is committed. Implementing CI/CD practices enhances collaboration, reduces integration issues, and accelerates delivery.

**Python Example (CI/CD with GitHub Actions):**
```yaml
# .github/workflows/python-app.yml
name: Python application

on: [push]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      with:
        python-version: '3.x'
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install -r requirements.txt
    - name: Run tests
      run: |
        pytest
```

**Java Example (CI/CD with Jenkins and Maven):**
```groovy
// Jenkinsfile
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                sh 'mvn clean install'
            }
        }
        stage('

Test') {
            steps {
                sh 'mvn test'
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                sh 'mvn deploy'
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**Practical Exercise:**
- **Build a CI/CD Pipeline**: Implement a pipeline that includes testing and deployment automation, allowing participants to see how automated processes enhance the development workflow.

### **4. Quality Assurance Practices**

#### **Code Quality Metrics**
- **Code Complexity**: Understanding metrics such as cyclomatic complexity helps teams assess the complexity of their code and identify areas that may require refactoring for improved maintainability.

**Python Example (Code Complexity with `radon`):**
```bash
# Install radon
pip install radon

# Measure cyclomatic complexity
radon cc my_code.py -a
```

**Java Example (Code Complexity with SonarQube):**
```xml
<!-- Add to pom.xml -->
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.sonarsource.scanner.maven</groupId>
    <artifactId>sonar-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>3.9.0.2155</version>
    <executions>
        <execution>
            <goals>
                <goal>sonar</goal>
            </goals>
        </execution>
    </executions>
</plugin>
```

#### **Static and Dynamic Analysis**
- **Static Analysis**: Tools such as linters and code analyzers help identify potential errors, code smells, and compliance with coding standards without executing the code.

- **Dynamic Analysis**: This approach involves testing the application while it is running, allowing for real-time identification of issues such as memory leaks and performance bottlenecks.

**Python Example (Static Analysis with `flake8`):**
```bash
# Install flake8
pip install flake8

# Run flake8 on a Python file
flake8 my_code.py
```

**Java Example (Static Analysis with FindBugs):**
```xml
<!-- Add to pom.xml -->
<plugin>
    <groupId>com.google.code.findbugs</groupId>
    <artifactId>findbugs-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>3.0.5</version>
    <executions>
        <execution>
            <goals>
                <goal>check</goal>
            </goals>
        </execution>
    </executions>
</plugin>
```

#### **Bug Tracking and Management**
- **Bug Tracking Systems**: Utilizing tools like Jira or Bugzilla enables teams to effectively manage and prioritize bugs throughout the software development lifecycle. Proper bug tracking helps in maintaining clarity and accountability, ensuring that all issues are addressed in a timely manner.

**Practical Exercise:**
- **Setup a Bug Tracking System**: Create and manage bugs in a project using a bug tracking system, fostering skills in tracking and reporting software defects.

### **5. Advanced Topics in Testing**

#### **Security Testing**
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Automated security assessments help identify potential vulnerabilities in applications. Regular security testing is essential for safeguarding sensitive user data and maintaining compliance with industry regulations.

**Python Example (Security Testing with `bandit`):**
```bash
# Install bandit
pip install bandit

# Run bandit on a Python file
bandit -r my_code.py
```

**Java Example (Security Testing with OWASP ZAP):**
```bash
# Run OWASP ZAP
zap.sh
# Use OWASP ZAP to scan a web application
```

#### **Usability Testing**
- **User Experience (UX)**: Evaluating and improving user experience based on real user feedback is essential for developing user-friendly applications. Usability testing helps teams understand how users interact with their software and identify pain points.

**Practical Exercise:**
- **Conduct Usability Testing**: Perform usability testing on a web application and analyze results, learning how to incorporate feedback into future development iterations.

#### **Test-Driven Development (TDD) and Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)**
- **TDD**: In this approach, tests are written before implementing features, following the Red-Green-Refactor cycle. TDD promotes a better understanding of requirements and encourages simpler, more modular code.

- **BDD**: BDD focuses on the behavior of the application, allowing stakeholders to collaborate on defining the expected functionality using natural language scenarios, making it easier to align technical and business perspectives.

**Python Example (TDD with `pytest`):**
```python
# test_calculator.py
def test_addition():
    assert add(1, 2) == 3

def test_subtraction():
    assert subtract(5, 3) == 2
```

**Java Example (BDD with Cucumber):**
```gherkin
# features/calculator.feature
Feature: Calculator
  Scenario: Addition
    Given I have two numbers 5 and 3
    When I add them
    Then the result should be 8
```

**Practical Exercise:**
- **Implement TDD/BDD**: Write and execute test cases using TDD or BDD methodologies for a given feature, reinforcing the concepts through practical application.

## **Assessment**

- **Weekly Testing Assignments**: Participants will implement and report on various testing techniques and tools, solidifying their understanding through hands-on practice.
