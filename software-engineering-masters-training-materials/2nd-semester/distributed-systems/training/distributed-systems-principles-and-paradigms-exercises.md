### **Self-Management in Distributed Systems**

Let's walk through each of these simulations step-by-step, providing an outline for implementation and the key components necessary for creating these distributed system models in Python.

### 1. **Feedback Control Simulation**

This simulation will mimic a distributed web server infrastructure where the number of servers (or instances) is dynamically adjusted based on user load (CPU usage). 

#### Steps:
- **Simulate incoming traffic**: Use random numbers to represent user requests per minute.
- **Monitor CPU usage**: Simulate CPU usage for each server based on traffic load.
- **Feedback control**: Implement a control system that monitors CPU usage and adjusts the number of servers dynamically (e.g., if CPU usage exceeds 70%, add a new server, and if it drops below 30%, reduce the number of servers).
  
#### Key Python Libraries:
- `random`: For generating simulated traffic and load.
- `matplotlib` or `plotly`: For visualizing server count and load.

#### Pseudocode:
```python
import random
import time

# Constants
MAX_CPU_LOAD = 70  # Threshold to increase servers
MIN_CPU_LOAD = 30  # Threshold to reduce servers
initial_servers = 3

def simulate_load(servers):
    return [random.randint(10, 50) + (servers * random.randint(0, 5)) for _ in range(servers)]

def feedback_control(servers, cpu_usage):
    avg_cpu = sum(cpu_usage) / len(cpu_usage)
    if avg_cpu > MAX_CPU_LOAD:
        servers += 1  # Add server
    elif avg_cpu < MIN_CPU_LOAD and servers > 1:
        servers -= 1  # Remove server
    return servers

# Simulation Loop
servers = initial_servers
for i in range(50):  # Run simulation for 50 cycles
    cpu_usage = simulate_load(servers)
    print(f"Cycle {i}: Servers: {servers}, CPU Usage: {cpu_usage}")
    servers = feedback_control(servers, cpu_usage)
    time.sleep(1)
```

### 2. **Astrolabe-Style Monitoring**

This project simulates a distributed monitoring system with three nodes, where each node reports resource utilization (CPU and memory). A central node aggregates and summarizes the data.

#### Steps:
- **Simulate nodes**: Each node randomly generates CPU and memory utilization values.
- **Aggregate data**: A central node collects this data, aggregates it, and produces a summary.
  
#### Key Python Libraries:
- `psutil`: For simulating CPU and memory utilization.
- `threading`: For simulating the distributed nature of the nodes.

#### Pseudocode:
```python
import random
import threading
import time

# Simulate node resource utilization
def simulate_node(node_id):
    while True:
        cpu = random.randint(10, 100)  # Random CPU usage
        memory = random.randint(100, 8000)  # Random Memory usage in MB
        resource_data[node_id] = {'cpu': cpu, 'memory': memory}
        time.sleep(1)  # Collect every second

# Aggregator to gather data from nodes
def aggregator():
    while True:
        total_cpu = sum([v['cpu'] for v in resource_data.values()])
        total_memory = sum([v['memory'] for v in resource_data.values()])
        print(f"Aggregated Data: CPU: {total_cpu}%, Memory: {total_memory}MB")
        time.sleep(2)  # Aggregate every 2 seconds

resource_data = {}
threads = []
for i in range(3):  # Simulate 3 nodes
    t = threading.Thread(target=simulate_node, args=(i,))
    threads.append(t)
    t.start()

# Start aggregator
aggregator()
```

### 3. **Replication Strategy Comparison**

This simulation compares two strategies: full replication (replicating content to all nodes) versus selective replication (replicating content based on demand).

#### Steps:
- **Full replication**: All content is replicated to every node.
- **Selective replication**: Only frequently accessed content is replicated to a subset of nodes.
- **Measure performance**: Track bandwidth usage, response times, and replication latency for each approach.

#### Pseudocode:
```python
import random
import time

# Simulate a request
def generate_request(node, content):
    if content in node:
        return "Served locally"
    return "Fetching remotely"

# Full replication: Every node has all content
def full_replication(content_list):
    return [content_list[:] for _ in range(3)]  # All nodes get the full list

# Selective replication: Nodes only get part of the content
def selective_replication(content_list):
    return [[random.choice(content_list) for _ in range(2)] for _ in range(3)]

content = ['file1', 'file2', 'file3', 'file4', 'file5']
print("Full Replication Strategy:")
nodes_full = full_replication(content)
print(nodes_full)

print("Selective Replication Strategy:")
nodes_selective = selective_replication(content)
print(nodes_selective)

# Simulate a request and measure response time
print(generate_request(nodes_full[0], 'file3'))  # Full replication
print(generate_request(nodes_selective[0], 'file3'))  # Selective replication
```

### 4. **Automatic Repair in Distributed Systems**

This system simulates random service failures and restarts them automatically when they fail.

#### Steps:
- **Random failure**: Services (simulated as processes) fail randomly.
- **Monitoring and restarting**: A monitoring system checks the status and restarts failed services.

#### Pseudocode:
```python
import random
import time
import threading

# Simulate services running
def service(service_id):
    while True:
        if random.random() < 0.1:  # 10% chance of failure
            print(f"Service {service_id} failed!")
            break
        print(f"Service {service_id} running")
        time.sleep(2)

# Monitoring system that restarts failed services
def monitor():
    while True:
        for service_id, thread in service_threads.items():
            if not thread.is_alive():
                print(f"Restarting Service {service_id}")
                new_thread = threading.Thread(target=service, args=(service_id,))
                service_threads[service_id] = new_thread
                new_thread.start()
        time.sleep(5)

service_threads = {}
for i in range(3):
    t = threading.Thread(target=service, args=(i,))
    service_threads[i] = t
    t.start()

monitor()
```

---

### 5. **Dynamic Resource Allocation**

This simulation dynamically allocates resources (CPU, memory) to services based on load.

#### Steps:
- **Monitor load**: Each service generates a random load.
- **Reallocate resources**: Reclaim resources from underutilized services and allocate them to overutilized ones.

#### Pseudocode:
```python
import random
import time

def dynamic_allocation(service_loads):
    total_cpu = 100  # Total CPU resources
    total_mem = 1000  # Total memory resources
    for service in service_loads:
        cpu_alloc = min(service['load'], total_cpu)
        mem_alloc = min(service['load'] * 10, total_mem)
        service['cpu_alloc'] = cpu_alloc
        service['mem_alloc'] = mem_alloc
        total_cpu -= cpu_alloc
        total_mem -= mem_alloc
    return service_loads

service_loads = [{'load': random.randint(1, 50)} for _ in range(3)]

while True:
    service_loads = dynamic_allocation(service_loads)
    print(service_loads)
    time.sleep(2)
```

---

### 6. **Monitoring and Logging System**

This task requires setting up a time series database to log distributed service metrics and creating visualizations.

#### Steps:
- **Simulate distributed services**: Services generate performance metrics over time.
- **Log metrics**: Store metrics like CPU, memory in a time series database (such as InfluxDB).
- **Visualize**: Use `matplotlib` or a dashboard like Grafana to visualize trends and anomalies.

#### Pseudocode (for logging to a file):
```python
import random
import time

# Simulate metrics
def log_metrics():
    with open('service_metrics.log', 'a') as f:
        for _ in range(100):
            cpu = random.randint(0, 100)
            memory = random.randint(0, 8000)
            f.write(f"{time.time()}, CPU: {cpu}, Memory: {memory}\n")
            time.sleep(1)

log_metrics()
```

Let's break down each of these tasks and provide an outline for implementing them, along with sample code and key concepts for understanding how multithreading and concurrency work in Python.

---

### 7. **Multi-threaded TCP Server**

This project involves building a basic multi-threaded TCP server that handles multiple clients simultaneously. Each client connection will be handled by a separate thread.

#### Steps:
- **Create a TCP server**: Use Python's `socket` module to create the server.
- **Handle clients with threads**: Each time a client connects, create a new thread to handle the connection.
  
#### Key Libraries:
- `socket`: For network communication.
- `threading`: For handling multiple clients concurrently.

#### Pseudocode:
```python
import socket
import threading

# Function to handle client connections
def handle_client(client_socket):
    while True:
        try:
            message = client_socket.recv(1024).decode('utf-8')
            if not message:
                break
            print(f"Received: {message}")
            client_socket.send(f"Echo: {message}".encode('utf-8'))
        except:
            break
    client_socket.close()

# Create server socket
server = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
server.bind(('0.0.0.0', 9999))
server.listen(5)
print("Server started...")

while True:
    client_socket, addr = server.accept()
    print(f"Accepted connection from {addr}")
    client_handler = threading.Thread(target=handle_client, args=(client_socket,))
    client_handler.start()
```

### 8. **Parallel Data Processing with Threads**

Parallelize a computation task like finding prime numbers using threads, and compare performance with sequential processing.

#### Steps:
- **Sequential task**: Calculate prime numbers sequentially.
- **Parallel task**: Use threads to divide the task into smaller chunks, where each thread computes a portion of the work.

#### Key Libraries:
- `threading`: For parallel execution.
- `time`: To measure performance.

#### Pseudocode:
```python
import threading
import time

# Function to check prime numbers
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

# Sequential execution
def find_primes_sequential(limit):
    primes = []
    for num in range(limit):
        if is_prime(num):
            primes.append(num)
    return primes

# Parallel execution using threads
def find_primes_parallel(limit, num_threads):
    primes = []
    threads = []
    step = limit // num_threads

    def worker(start, end):
        local_primes = []
        for num in range(start, end):
            if is_prime(num):
                local_primes.append(num)
        primes.extend(local_primes)

    for i in range(num_threads):
        t = threading.Thread(target=worker, args=(i * step, (i + 1) * step))
        threads.append(t)
        t.start()

    for t in threads:
        t.join()

    return primes

# Measure performance
start_time = time.time()
primes_seq = find_primes_sequential(100000)
print("Sequential time:", time.time() - start_time)

start_time = time.time()
primes_parallel = find_primes_parallel(100000, 4)
print("Parallel time:", time.time() - start_time)
```

### 9. **Thread Synchronization (Producer-Consumer)**

In this task, implement a producer-consumer problem where one thread produces data and another consumes it. Synchronization is essential to avoid race conditions.

#### Steps:
- **Producer thread**: Generates data (e.g., random numbers) and adds them to a shared buffer.
- **Consumer thread**: Consumes data from the shared buffer.
- **Synchronization**: Use locks or semaphores to control access to the shared buffer.

#### Key Libraries:
- `threading`: For multithreading and synchronization.
- `queue`: For a thread-safe shared buffer.

#### Pseudocode:
```python
import threading
import time
import queue
import random

# Buffer (shared resource)
buffer = queue.Queue(maxsize=10)

# Producer thread function
def producer():
    while True:
        item = random.randint(1, 100)
        buffer.put(item)
        print(f"Produced: {item}")
        time.sleep(random.random())

# Consumer thread function
def consumer():
    while True:
        item = buffer.get()
        print(f"Consumed: {item}")
        buffer.task_done()
        time.sleep(random.random())

# Start threads
producer_thread = threading.Thread(target=producer)
consumer_thread = threading.Thread(target=consumer)

producer_thread.start()
consumer_thread.start()

producer_thread.join()
consumer_thread.join()
```

---

### 10. **Thread Pool Implementation**

Create a thread pool where a fixed number of threads handle tasks from a job queue. This is useful for controlling the number of threads used for task processing.

#### Steps:
- **Job queue**: Implement a queue where tasks are added.
- **Thread pool**: Create a pool of worker threads that process tasks from the queue.

#### Key Libraries:
- `threading`: For worker threads.
- `queue`: For task queue management.

#### Pseudocode:
```python
import threading
import queue
import time

# Worker function that processes tasks from the queue
def worker(job_queue):
    while True:
        task = job_queue.get()
        if task is None:  # Stop condition
            break
        print(f"Processing {task}")
        time.sleep(1)  # Simulate task processing
        job_queue.task_done()

# Job queue
job_queue = queue.Queue()

# Create a thread pool
num_workers = 4
threads = []
for i in range(num_workers):
    t = threading.Thread(target=worker, args=(job_queue,))
    t.start()
    threads.append(t)

# Add jobs to the queue
for i in range(10):
    job_queue.put(f"Task {i}")

# Wait for all tasks to be completed
job_queue.join()

# Stop workers
for i in range(num_workers):
    job_queue.put(None)  # Stop signal

# Join threads
for t in threads:
    t.join()
```

---

### 11. **Deadlock Detection**

Simulate a scenario where multiple threads can lead to deadlocks, and implement a deadlock detection algorithm like the wait-for graph.

#### Steps:
- **Simulate deadlock**: Create a scenario with multiple locks where threads get stuck waiting on each other.
- **Deadlock detection**: Implement a mechanism to detect and resolve deadlocks.

#### Pseudocode:
```python
import threading
import time

# Simulate a potential deadlock
lock1 = threading.Lock()
lock2 = threading.Lock()

def thread1():
    with lock1:
        time.sleep(1)
        with lock2:
            print("Thread 1 acquired both locks")

def thread2():
    with lock2:
        time.sleep(1)
        with lock1:
            print("Thread 2 acquired both locks")

t1 = threading.Thread(target=thread1)
t2 = threading.Thread(target=thread2)

t1.start()
t2.start()

t1.join()
t2.join()

# Implement a deadlock detection mechanism (like a wait-for graph)
# Deadlock detection algorithms would typically check for cycles in a graph.
```

import concurrent.futures
import time

# Task function to be executed asynchronously
def task(n):
    time.sleep(2)
    return n * n

# Use a thread pool for asynchronous execution
with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:
    futures = [executor.submit(task, i) for i in range(5)]
    
    for future in concurrent.futures.as_completed(futures):
        print(f"Result: {future.result()}")
```

   import os

   app = Flask(__name__)
   UPLOAD_FOLDER = './uploads'
   os.makedirs(UPLOAD_FOLDER, exist_ok=True)

   @app.route('/upload', methods=['POST'])
   def upload_file():
       file = request.files['file']
       file.save(os.path.join(UPLOAD_FOLDER, file.filename))
       return "File uploaded successfully!", 200

   @app.route('/download/<filename>', methods=['GET'])
   def download_file(filename):
       return send_from_directory(UPLOAD_FOLDER, filename)

   if __name__ == '__main__':
       app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5000)
   ```

2. **Create the Frontend (HTML/JavaScript)**:
   - Build a simple web client for file uploads and downloads:
   ```html
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html>
   <head>
       <title>File Upload/Download</title>
   </head>
   <body>
       <h1>Upload File</h1>
       <input type="file" id="fileInput">
       <button onclick="uploadFile()">Upload</button>

       <h1>Download File</h1>
       <input type="text" id="filename" placeholder="Enter filename">
       <button onclick="downloadFile()">Download</button>

       <script>
           function uploadFile() {
               const fileInput = document.getElementById('fileInput');
               const formData = new FormData();
               formData.append('file', fileInput.files[0]);

               fetch('http://localhost:5000/upload', {
                   method: 'POST',
                   body: formData
               }).then(response => response.text())
                 .then(data => alert(data));
           }

           function downloadFile() {
               const filename = document.getElementById('filename').value;
               window.location.href = `http://localhost:5000/download/${filename}`;
           }
       </script>
   </body>
   </html>
   ```

3. **Run and Test**:
   - Start the Flask server and open the HTML file in a browser to test file uploads and downloads.

#### Concepts:
- **HTTP Methods**: `POST` for upload, `GET` for download.
- **Web Client**: Using JavaScript’s `fetch` API to interact with the server.
- **Distributed System**: You can extend this with multiple servers, each storing parts of the files.

---

### 20. **Implement Client-Side Caching**

In this task, you will build a client-server system where the client implements caching to reduce network traffic and improve performance.

#### Steps:
1. **Set up the Backend**:
   - Use the Flask backend from the previous task to handle file requests, but simulate slow server responses:
   ```python
   import time

   @app.route('/data/<filename>', methods=['GET'])
   def serve_file(filename):
       time.sleep(2)  # Simulate delay
       return send_from_directory(UPLOAD_FOLDER, filename)
   ```

2. **Implement Client-Side Caching (JavaScript)**:
   - Modify the web client to cache file responses locally using the browser’s `localStorage`:
   ```javascript
   function getFile(filename) {
       const cachedData = localStorage.getItem(filename);
       if (cachedData) {
           alert("Serving from cache");
           displayFile(cachedData);
           return;
       }

       fetch(`http://localhost:5000/data/${filename}`)
           .then(response => response.text())
           .then(data => {
               localStorage.setItem(filename, data);
               alert("Serving from server");
               displayFile(data);
           });
   }

   function displayFile(data) {
       document.getElementById('fileContent').textContent = data;
   }
   ```

3. **Test Caching**:
   - Load a file from the server and verify it is cached by reloading the page or requesting the file again, checking that it is served from the cache without delay.

#### Concepts:
- **Caching**: Storing data locally to reduce repeated server requests.
- **Performance Improvement**: Faster access to frequently used data by avoiding network latency.

---

### 21. **Client Load Testing Tool**

In this task, you will create a client-side tool that simulates multiple requests to a server, measuring response times and throughput.

#### Steps:
1. **Create the Load Testing Script (Python)**:
   - Use Python’s `requests` library to send multiple HTTP requests to the server:
   ```python
   import requests
   import time
   from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor

   SERVER_URL = 'http://localhost:5000/data/sample.txt'

   def send_request():
       start_time = time.time()
       response = requests.get(SERVER_URL)
       return time.time() - start_time

   def load_test(requests_count):
       with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=10) as executor:
           response_times = list(executor.map(send_request, range(requests_count)))
       return response_times

   if __name__ == '__main__':
       num_requests = 100
       times = load_test(num_requests)
       print(f"Average response time: {sum(times)/len(times):.2f} seconds")
   ```

2. **Test with Different Loads**:
   - Adjust the number of requests and observe how the server performs under different load conditions.

#### Concepts:
- **Load Testing**: Simulating a high number of requests to measure server performance.
- **Metrics**: Response time, throughput (requests per second).

---

### 22. **RESTful API Client**

In this task, you will implement a client that interacts with a RESTful API to perform CRUD operations.

#### Steps:
1. **Set up the Backend (Flask)**:
   - Create a simple REST API to manage resources (e.g., products):
   ```python
   from flask import Flask, jsonify, request

   app = Flask(__name__)

   products = []

   @app.route('/products', methods=['GET'])
   def get_products():
       return jsonify(products)

   @app.route('/products', methods=['POST'])
   def add_product():
       new_product = request.json
       products.append(new_product)
       return jsonify(new_product), 201

   @app.route('/products/<int:product_id>', methods=['PUT'])
   def update_product(product_id):
       product = products[product_id]
       product.update(request.json)
       return jsonify(product)

   @app.route('/products/<int:product_id>', methods=['DELETE'])
   def delete_product(product_id):
       products.pop(product_id)
       return '', 204

   if __name__ == '__main__':
       app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5000)
   ```

2. **Implement the Client (Python)**:
   - Create a Python client to interact with the API:
   ```python
   import requests

   BASE_URL = 'http://localhost:5000/products'

   def create_product(name, price):
       response = requests.post(BASE_URL, json={'name': name, 'price': price})
       print(response.json())

   def get_products():
       response = requests.get(BASE_URL)
       print(response.json())

   def update_product(product_id, name, price):
       response = requests.put(f'{BASE_URL}/{product_id}', json={'name': name, 'price': price})
       print(response.json())

   def delete_product(product_id):
       response = requests.delete(f'{BASE_URL}/{product_id}')
       print("Product deleted" if response.status_code == 204 else "Failed")

   if __name__ == '__main__':
       create_product('Laptop', 1200)
       get_products()
       update_product(0, 'Laptop Pro', 1500)
       delete_product(0)
   ```

3. **Test the Client**:
   - Run the client to perform CRUD operations, ensuring the API handles different requests correctly.

#### Concepts:
- **CRUD Operations**: Create, Read, Update, Delete.
- **RESTful API**: A standard API architecture using HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
- **Error Handling**: Handling status codes (e.g., 404 for not found, 500 for server errors).

---

### **Servers in Distributed Systems**

Here’s a detailed overview and guide for each of these advanced tasks, focusing on concurrent servers, load balancing, fault tolerance, distributed caching, and real-time communication with WebSockets.

---

### 23. **Design a Concurrent Web Server**

In this task, you will write a basic concurrent web server that can handle multiple client requests simultaneously using threading or asynchronous I/O.

#### Steps:

1. **Threaded Web Server**:
   - Use Python’s `socket` library along with the `threading` module to create a web server that handles multiple requests using separate threads:
   ```python
   import socket
   from threading import Thread

   def handle_client(client_socket):
       request = client_socket.recv(1024)
       print(f"Received request: {request.decode()}")
       response = b"HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\nContent-Type: text/html\r\n\r\n<h1>Hello, World!</h1>"
       client_socket.send(response)
       client_socket.close()

   def start_server():
       server_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
       server_socket.bind(('0.0.0.0', 8080))
       server_socket.listen(5)
       print("Server listening on port 8080")

       while True:
           client_socket, addr = server_socket.accept()
           print(f"Connection from {addr}")
           client_thread = Thread(target=handle_client, args=(client_socket,))
           client_thread.start()

   if __name__ == "__main__":
       start_server()
   ```

2. **Asynchronous Web Server (Optional)**:
   - Use Python's `asyncio` and `aiohttp` libraries to implement an asynchronous web server that can handle large numbers of clients without the overhead of threading:
   ```python
   import asyncio
   from aiohttp import web

   async def handle(request):
       return web.Response(text="Hello, World!")

   app = web.Application()
   app.router.add_get('/', handle)

   if __name__ == '__main__':
       web.run_app(app, port=8080)
   ```

3. **Simulate Load**:
   - Use a tool like `ApacheBench` (ab) or create a simple Python script using `requests` and `ThreadPoolExecutor` to simulate multiple concurrent client requests.

#### Concepts:
- **Concurrency**: Using threading or async I/O to handle multiple requests simultaneously.
- **Threading vs Async I/O**: Threading is suitable for I/O-bound tasks, while async I/O can handle larger numbers of clients with lower overhead.

---

### 24. **Server Load Balancing Simulation**

In this task, you will create a simple load balancer that distributes incoming requests across multiple server instances to improve performance and availability.

#### Steps:

1. **Backend Servers**:
   - Set up multiple instances of the server from Task 23, each running on a different port (e.g., 8081, 8082, etc.).

2. **Load Balancer**:
   - Write a simple load balancer that listens for incoming client requests and forwards them to different backend servers in a round-robin fashion:
   ```python
   import socket

   backend_servers = [('127.0.0.1', 8081), ('127.0.0.1', 8082)]
   current_server = 0

   def start_load_balancer():
       load_balancer_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
       load_balancer_socket.bind(('0.0.0.0', 8080))
       load_balancer_socket.listen(5)
       print("Load balancer listening on port 8080")

       global current_server
       while True:
           client_socket, addr = load_balancer_socket.accept()
           backend = backend_servers[current_server]
           current_server = (current_server + 1) % len(backend_servers)

           backend_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
           backend_socket.connect(backend)
           request = client_socket.recv(1024)
           backend_socket.send(request)
           response = backend_socket.recv(1024)
           client_socket.send(response)
           client_socket.close()
           backend_socket.close()

   if __name__ == "__main__":
       start_load_balancer()
   ```

3. **Test Load Distribution**:
   - Simulate multiple requests and observe how the load balancer distributes them evenly between the backend servers.

#### Concepts:
- **Load Balancing**: Distributing incoming traffic across multiple servers to optimize resource utilization.
- **Round-Robin**: A simple, fair load balancing strategy that rotates through available servers.

---

### 25. **Fault Tolerance in Server Clusters**

This task involves creating a system where multiple servers handle requests and implement fault tolerance by rerouting traffic from failed servers.

#### Steps:

1. **Set Up the Backend**:
   - Run multiple instances of the server from Task 23.

2. **Fault Tolerant Load Balancer**:
   - Modify the load balancer to handle server failures by detecting if a backend server is down and rerouting requests to the next available server:
   ```python
   import socket

   backend_servers = [('127.0.0.1', 8081), ('127.0.0.1', 8082)]
   current_server = 0

   def is_server_alive(server):
       try:
           test_socket = socket.create_connection(server, timeout=2)
           test_socket.close()
           return True
       except:
           return False

   def start_load_balancer():
       load_balancer_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
       load_balancer_socket.bind(('0.0.0.0', 8080))
       load_balancer_socket.listen(5)
       print("Load balancer listening on port 8080")

       global current_server
       while True:
           client_socket, addr = load_balancer_socket.accept()

           while not is_server_alive(backend_servers[current_server]):
               current_server = (current_server + 1) % len(backend_servers)

           backend = backend_servers[current_server]
           backend_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
           backend_socket.connect(backend)
           request = client_socket.recv(1024)
           backend_socket.send(request)
           response = backend_socket.recv(1024)
           client_socket.send(response)
           client_socket.close()
           backend_socket.close()

   if __name__ == "__main__":
       start_load_balancer()
   ```

3. **Simulate Server Failures**:
   - Stop one of the backend servers and ensure the load balancer detects the failure and reroutes traffic to the remaining servers.

#### Concepts:
- **Fault Tolerance**: Ensuring continued operation even when parts of the system fail.
- **Health Checks**: Periodically checking if servers are operational.

---

### 26. **Distributed Caching System**

In this task, you will create a distributed caching system across multiple servers, implementing a caching strategy like Least Recently Used (LRU).

#### Steps:

1. **Backend Servers**:
   - Set up multiple server instances, each with its own cache.

2. **Caching Logic**:
   - Implement an LRU caching strategy in each server using Python’s `OrderedDict`:
   ```python
   from collections import OrderedDict

   class LRUCache:
       def __init__(self, capacity):
           self.cache = OrderedDict()
           self.capacity = capacity

       def get(self, key):
           if key not in self.cache:
               return -1
           self.cache.move_to_end(key)
           return self.cache[key]

       def put(self, key, value):
           if key in self.cache:
               self.cache.move_to_end(key)
           self.cache[key] = value
           if len(self.cache) > self.capacity:
               self.cache.popitem(last=False)
   ```

3. **Distribute the Cache**:
   - Each server only caches part of the data, and the load balancer routes requests to the appropriate cache server.

4. **Test Performance**:
   - Measure the response times with and without the caching system to observe performance improvements.

#### Concepts:
- **Distributed Caching**: Storing frequently accessed data across multiple servers.
- **LRU Caching**: A strategy that removes the least recently used data when cache capacity is exceeded.

---

### 27. **HTTP Server with WebSocket Support**

In this task, you will create an HTTP server that supports WebSocket connections for real-time communication between clients.

#### Steps:

1. **Install WebSocket Library**:
   - Use the `websockets` library in Python to support WebSocket connections:
   ```bash
   pip install websockets
   ```

2. **WebSocket Server**:
   - Implement a simple WebSocket server:
   ```python
   import asyncio
   import websockets

   connected_clients = set()

   async def handle_client(websocket, path):
       connected_clients.add(websocket)
       try:
           async for message in websocket:
               print(f"Received message: {message}")
               for client in connected_clients:
                   if client != websocket:
                       await client.send(message)
       finally:
           connected_clients.remove(websocket)

   start_server = websockets.serve(handle_client, 'localhost', 8080)

   asyncio.get_event_loop().run_until_complete(start_server)
   asyncio.get_event_loop().run_forever()
   ```

3. **WebSocket Client (HTML)**:
   - Create a simple client using JavaScript to send and receive messages:
   ```html
   <html>
   <body>
       <h1>WebSocket Chat</h1>
       <input id="messageInput" type="text">
       <button onclick="sendMessage()">Send</button>
       <ul id="messages"></ul>

       <script>
           const socket = new Web

Socket('ws://localhost:8080');

           socket.onmessage = function(event) {
               const li = document.createElement('li');
               li.textContent = event.data;
               document.getElementById('messages').appendChild(li);
           };

           function sendMessage() {
               const message = document.getElementById('messageInput').value;
               socket.send(message);
           }
       </script>
   </body>
   </html>
   ```

4. **Test Real-Time Messaging**:
   - Open multiple clients and observe real-time messaging between them via the WebSocket server.

#### Concepts:
- **WebSockets**: Enables full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection.
- **Real-Time Communication**: Supporting applications like chat, live updates, etc.

---

### **Code Migration in Distributed Systems**

Here’s a detailed guide for implementing the last set of tasks, focusing on code migration, serverless computing, Docker-based heterogeneous environments, Function as a Service (FaaS), and multi-language execution environments.

---

### 28. **Basic Code Migration Simulation**

In this task, you’ll simulate a code migration process by transferring and executing Python scripts on a remote machine using SSH.

#### Steps:

1. **Set Up SSH Access**:
   - Ensure SSH is configured between two machines (or two VMs). You may need to set up SSH keys for passwordless access.
   - Test the SSH connection:
     ```bash
     ssh user@remote_host
     ```

2. **Transfer Python Script**:
   - Use `scp` to copy the Python script from the local machine to the remote machine:
     ```bash
     scp my_script.py user@remote_host:/path/to/destination
     ```

3. **Remote Execution via SSH**:
   - After transferring the script, execute it on the remote machine using SSH:
     ```bash
     ssh user@remote_host 'python3 /path/to/destination/my_script.py'
     ```

4. **Automate with a Python Script**:
   - Use Python's `subprocess` module to automate the transfer and execution:
   ```python
   import subprocess

   def migrate_and_execute(script_path, remote_host, remote_path, user):
       # Copy the script to the remote machine
       scp_command = f"scp {script_path} {user}@{remote_host}:{remote_path}"
       subprocess.run(scp_command, shell=True)

       # Execute the script on the remote machine
       ssh_command = f"ssh {user}@{remote_host} 'python3 {remote_path}'"
       subprocess.run(ssh_command, shell=True)

   migrate_and_execute('my_script.py', 'remote_host', '/path/to/destination/my_script.py', 'user')
   ```

#### Concepts:
- **SSH**: Secure Shell for remote command execution.
- **Code Migration**: Moving code from one machine to another and executing it remotely.

---

### 29. **Serverless Computing Simulation**

In this task, you will simulate serverless computing by executing a Python function in response to a specific event in an event-driven architecture.

#### Steps:

1. **Event Trigger Simulation**:
   - Create an event listener that triggers the function execution. You can simulate an event like an HTTP request using Python’s `Flask` framework.

2. **Flask-Based Event System**:
   - Set up a simple Flask application that executes a function in response to a request:
   ```python
   from flask import Flask, request

   app = Flask(__name__)

   def handle_event(data):
       # Simulate function execution
       return f"Function executed with data: {data}"

   @app.route('/trigger', methods=['POST'])
   def trigger_function():
       event_data = request.json.get('data')
       result = handle_event(event_data)
       return result

   if __name__ == '__main__':
       app.run(port=5000)
   ```

3. **Invoke the Function**:
   - Trigger the function execution by sending an event (HTTP request):
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/trigger -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"data": "test event"}'
   ```

4. **Enhancements**:
   - Implement an event queue to simulate real-world event-driven architectures. Use libraries like `celery` or Python's `queue`.

#### Concepts:
- **Serverless**: Code execution without worrying about server management.
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Functions are triggered by specific events (like HTTP requests).

---

### 30. **Code Migration in Heterogeneous Environments**

In this task, you’ll simulate running a Python script in different operating systems using Docker containers.

#### Steps:

1. **Set Up Docker**:
   - Ensure Docker is installed and running on your system.

2. **Create Dockerfiles for Different Environments**:
   - Create a `Dockerfile` for a Linux-based container:
   ```Dockerfile
   # Dockerfile for Linux environment
   FROM python:3.9-slim
   COPY my_script.py /my_script.py
   CMD ["python", "/my_script.py"]
   ```
   - Create a `Dockerfile` for a Windows-based container (requires Docker Desktop with Windows containers enabled):
   ```Dockerfile
   # Dockerfile for Windows environment
   FROM mcr.microsoft.com/windows/servercore:ltsc2019
   COPY my_script.py C:/my_script.py
   RUN ["python", "C:/my_script.py"]
   ```

3. **Build and Run Containers**:
   - Build and run the Docker containers to execute the Python script in both environments:
   ```bash
   docker build -t linux-script -f Dockerfile-linux .
   docker run linux-script

   docker build -t windows-script -f Dockerfile-windows .
   docker run windows-script
   ```

4. **Migrate Between Containers**:
   - To simulate migration, you can save the script output to a volume that both containers share or use Docker's `save` and `load` commands to migrate the container between hosts.

#### Concepts:
- **Heterogeneous Environments**: Different operating systems executing the same code.
- **Docker**: A containerization platform that simplifies running code in different environments.

---

### 31. **Function as a Service (FaaS) Implementation**

In this task, you’ll build a basic FaaS platform where users can deploy and trigger functions via HTTP.

#### Steps:

1. **Set Up a Flask API**:
   - Create a Flask-based platform to deploy and trigger functions:
   ```python
   from flask import Flask, request
   import subprocess

   app = Flask(__name__)

   @app.route('/deploy', methods=['POST'])
   def deploy_function():
       function_code = request.json.get('code')
       with open('user_function.py', 'w') as f:
           f.write(function_code)
       return "Function deployed!"

   @app.route('/execute', methods=['GET'])
   def execute_function():
       result = subprocess.run(['python', 'user_function.py'], capture_output=True, text=True)
       return result.stdout

   if __name__ == '__main__':
       app.run(port=5000)
   ```

2. **Deploy and Trigger Functions**:
   - Deploy a function by sending the function code in a POST request:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/deploy -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"code": "print(\"Hello from FaaS!\")"}'
   ```
   - Trigger the function execution:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:5000/execute
   ```

3. **Add Monitoring and Scaling**:
   - Add basic monitoring using Python's `psutil` to track CPU usage or memory. Implement a simple scaling mechanism to handle multiple function invocations concurrently (e.g., using `ThreadPoolExecutor`).

#### Concepts:
- **FaaS**: Functions are deployed and triggered on-demand, abstracting away the underlying infrastructure.

### 32. **Multi-language Code Execution Environment**

In this task, you will design a system that can execute code in multiple programming languages, running within Docker containers.

#### Steps:

1. **Dockerfiles for Different Languages**:
   - Create separate Dockerfiles for Python, JavaScript (Node.js), etc.:
   ```Dockerfile
   # Dockerfile for Python environment
   FROM python:3.9-slim
   COPY user_code.py /user_code.py
   CMD ["python", "/user_code.py"]
   ```
   ```Dockerfile
   # Dockerfile for JavaScript (Node.js) environment
   FROM node:14
   COPY user_code.js /user_code.js
   CMD ["node", "/user_code.js"]
   ```

2. **Flask API for Code Submission**:
   - Create a Flask-based API to accept code in different languages and execute it in the appropriate Docker container:
   ```python
   from flask import Flask, request
   import subprocess

   app = Flask(__name__)

   @app.route('/execute', methods=['POST'])
   def execute_code():
       code = request.json.get('code')
       language = request.json.get('language')
       
       if language == 'python':
           with open('user_code.py', 'w') as f:
               f.write(code)
           result = subprocess.run(['docker', 'run', '--rm', '-v', f'{os.getcwd()}:/app', 'python-script'], capture_output=True, text=True)
       elif language == 'javascript':
           with open('user_code.js', 'w') as f:
               f.write(code)
           result = subprocess.run(['docker', 'run', '--rm', '-v', f'{os.getcwd()}:/app', 'node-script'], capture_output=True, text=True)

       return result.stdout

   if __name__ == '__main__':
       app.run(port=5000)
   ```

3. **Test Multi-language Execution**:
   - Deploy Python code:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/execute -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"code": "print(\"Hello from Python!\")", "language": "python"}'
   ```
   - Deploy JavaScript code:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/execute -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"code": "console.log(\"Hello from Node.js!\")", "language": "javascript"}'
   ``

   SERVICES = [
       "http://service1.com/health",
       "http://service2.com/health",
   ]

   def send_alert(service_url):
       msg = MIMEText(f"Alert: {service_url} is down!")
       msg['Subject'] = 'Service Alert'
       msg['From'] = 'monitor@example.com'
       msg['To'] = 'admin@example.com'

       with smtplib.SMTP('smtp.example.com') as server:
           server.login('user', 'password')
           server.send_message(msg)

   def monitor_services():
       while True:
           for service in SERVICES:
               try:
                   response = requests.get(service)
                   if response.status_code != 200:
                       send_alert(service)
               except requests.exceptions.RequestException:
                   send_alert(service)
           time.sleep(60)  # Check every minute

   if __name__ == "__main__":
       monitor_services()
   ```

2. **Configure Email Alerts**:

   ```python
   # Simulating database nodes
   db_nodes = {
       "node1": {"user1": "data1", "user2": "data2"},
       "node2": {"user3": "data3", "user4": "data4"},
   }
   ```

2. **Client Query Function**:
   - Write a function to query data:
   ```python
   def query_data(user_id):
       for node, data in db_nodes.items():
           if user_id in data:
               return data[user_id]
       return None
   ```

3. **Simulate Failures**:
   - Implement a mechanism to simulate node failures and query backup nodes:
   ```python
   import random

   def query_with_failover(user_id):
       # Randomly decide if a node fails
       if random.choice([True, False]):
           print("Node failure simulation")
           failed_node = random.choice(list(db_nodes.keys()))
           temp_data = db_nodes[failed_node]
           del db_nodes[failed_node]  # Simulate a node going down

           # Try to query the remaining nodes
           result = query_data(user_id)
           if result:
               return result
           else:
               print("Data not found, querying backup...")
               # Simulate querying backup or other nodes
       return query_data(user_id)
   ```

4. **Testing the System**:

       pass  # Implementation can vary

   node1 = threading.Thread(target=node_function, args=("Node1",))
   node2 = threading.Thread(target=node_function, args=("Node2",))
   node1.start()
   node2.start()
   ```

2. **Simulate Consistency and Availability**:
   - Implement a scenario where a network partition occurs, and demonstrate how your system behaves:
   ```python
   def send_message(sender, receiver, message):
       # Simulate sending messages between nodes
       print(f"{sender} sending message to {receiver}: {message}")

   # Simulate a partition
   def partition_network():
       print("Network partitioned between nodes")
       # Logic to block communication
   ```

3. **Analyze Behavior**:
   - Test your application by forcing network partitions and observing how consistency and availability are affected.

   jwt = JWTManager(app)

   @app.route('/login', methods=['POST'])
   def login():
       username = request.json.get('username')
       password = request.json.get('password')
       # Perform authentication (this is just a placeholder)
       if username == 'user' and password == 'password':
           token = create_access_token(identity=username)
           return jsonify(access_token=token), 200
       return jsonify({"msg": "Bad username or password"}), 401

   @app.route('/protected', methods=['GET'])
   @jwt_required()
   def protected():
       return jsonify(msg="You have accessed a protected route"), 200

   if __name__ == '__main__':
       app.run(port=5000)
   ```

3. **Test the Authentication**:
   - Use `curl` or Postman to log in and access protected routes:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/login -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"username":"user","password":"password"}'
   curl -X GET http://localhost:5000/protected -H "Authorization: Bearer <your_access_token>"

           response = requests.get(url)
           # You can log response time here if needed
       end_time = time.time()
       total_time = end_time - start_time
       return total_time
   ```

3. **Measure Throughput and Latency**:
   - Calculate throughput and average latency based on the response times.
   ```python
   def run_benchmark(url, num_requests):
       total_time = benchmark_request(url, num_requests)

   class Node:
       def __init__(self, id):
           self.id = id
           self.state = 'follower'  # Possible states: follower, candidate, leader

       def send_message(self, message, recipient):
           # Simulate sending a message to another node
           print(f"Node {self.id} sends '{message}' to Node {recipient.id}")
   ```

3. **Implement Basic Raft/Paxos Logic**:
   - Implement leader election and log replication logic.

           time.sleep(0.1)

   def release_lock(lock_name):
       r.delete(lock_name)
   ```

4. **Using the Lock Service**:
   - Wrap critical sections of your code with lock acquisition and release calls.
   ```python
   lock_name = "my_lock"

   if acquire_lock(lock_name):
       try:
           # Critical section of code
           print("Lock acquired, executing critical section")
       finally:
           release_lock(lock_name)
           print("Lock released")
   ```

### 43. **Latency Measurement in Distributed Systems**

Write a program to measure network latency between multiple distributed nodes and analyze the data to identify performance bottlenecks.

#### Steps:

1. **Set Up Nodes**:
   - Create a simple client-server model with Python sockets.
   ```python
   import socket
   import time

   def server():
       s = socket.socket()
       s.bind(('localhost', 5000))
       s.listen(1)
       conn, addr = s.accept()
       while True:
           data = conn.recv(1024)
           if not data:
               break
           conn.sendall(data)
       conn.close()

   def client():
       c = socket.socket()
       c.connect(('localhost', 5000))
       start_time = time.time()
       c.sendall(b'Hello, Server')
       c.recv(1024)
       latency = time.time() - start_time
       print(f"Latency: {latency * 1000} ms")
       c.close()
   ```

2. **Measure Latency**:
   - Run the client multiple times to average the latency.
   ```python
   total_latency = 0
   for _ in range(10):
       total_latency += client()
   avg_latency = total_latency / 10
   print(f"Average Latency: {avg_latency * 1000} ms")
   ```

3. **Analyze Results**:

### 47. **Using gRPC for Microservices Communication**

Build a microservices application using gRPC for communication between services, comparing performance and ease of use with traditional RESTful services.

#### Steps:

1. **Define gRPC Service**:
   - Create a `.proto` file to define service methods.
   ```proto
   syntax = "proto3";

   service UserService {
       rpc GetUser (UserRequest) returns (UserResponse);
   }

   message UserRequest {
       int32 user_id = 1;
   }

   message UserResponse {
       string name = 1;
       int32 age = 2;
   }
   ```

2. **Generate gRPC Code**:
   - Use the `protoc` compiler to generate server and client code.

3. **Implement the Server**:
   - Create a server that implements the gRPC service.
   ```python
   import grpc
   from concurrent import futures
   import user_pb2_grpc

   class UserService(user_pb2_grpc.UserServiceServicer):
       def GetUser(self, request, context):
           # Simulated response
           return user_pb2.UserResponse(name="John Doe", age=30)

   def serve():
       server = grpc.server(futures.ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=10))
       user_pb2_grpc.add_UserServiceServicer_to_server(UserService(), server)
       server.add_insecure_port('[::]:50051')
       server.start()
       server.wait_for_termination()
   ```

4. **Implement the Client**:

   def run():
       with grpc.insecure_channel('localhost:50051') as channel:
           stub = user_pb2_grpc.UserServiceStub(channel)
           response = stub.GetUser(user_pb2.UserRequest(user_id=1))
           print(f"User: {response.name}, Age: {response.age}")
   ```

5. **Compare with REST**:
   - Implement a similar service using REST and measure performance differences.

### 48. **Version Control for Distributed Systems**

Explore version control concepts by implementing a simple versioning system for distributed resources, allowing nodes to fetch and update resources based on their versions.

#### Steps:

1. **Define Resource Structure**:
   - Create a structure to hold versioned resources.
   ```python
   resources = {
       'file1.txt': {'version': 1, 'content': 'Hello World'},
       'file2.txt': {'version': 2, 'content': 'Python Rocks'},
   }
   ```

2. **Implement Fetch and Update Logic**:
   - Create functions to fetch the current version and update the resource.
   ```python
   def fetch_resource(resource_name):
       return resources.get(resource_name)

   def update_resource(resource_name, new_content):
       current_resource = fetch_resource(resource_name)
       current_resource['version'] += 1
       current_resource['content'] = new_content
   ```

3. **Version Checking**:
   - Add a mechanism to check versions before updates.
   ```python
   def update_if_latest(resource_name, new_content, expected_version):
       current_resource = fetch_resource(resource_name)
       if current_resource['version'] == expected_version:
           update_resource(resource_name, new_content)
           print(f"Updated {resource_name} to version {current_resource['version']}")
       else:
           print(f"Version mismatch for {resource_name}. Current version: {current_resource['version']}")
   ```

4. **Testing the Version Control System**:
   - Simulate resource updates and version checks.

### 49. **Simulating Network Partitioning**

Simulate network partitioning in a distributed application and implement recovery mechanisms to restore service availability after a partition is resolved.

#### Steps:

1. **Set Up Distributed Nodes**:
   - Create multiple nodes that can send and receive messages.
   ```python
   class Node:
       def __init__(self, id):
           self.id = id
           self.connected_nodes = []

       def connect(self, other_node):
           self.connected_nodes.append(other_node)

       def send_message(self, message, target_node):
           if target_node in self.connected_nodes:
               print(f"Node {self.id} sending '{message}' to Node {target_node.id}")
               target_node.receive_message(message)
           else:
               print(f"Node {self.id} cannot reach Node {target_node.id}")
   ```

2. **Simulate Network Partition**:
   - Create a function to disconnect nodes temporarily.
   ```python
   def partition_network(node_a, node_b):
       node_a.connected_nodes.remove(node_b)
       node_b.connected_nodes.remove(node_a)
       print(f"Network partitioned between Node {node_a.id} and Node {node_b.id}")
   ```

3. **Implement Recovery Logic**:
   - Reconnect nodes and allow for recovery.
   ```python
   def recover_network(node_a, node_b):
       node_a.connect(node_b)
       node_b.connect(node_a)
       print(f"Network recovered between Node {node_a.id} and Node {node_b.id}")
   ```

4. **Test Partitioning and Recovery**:
   - Simulate message passing before, during, and after a network partition.

#### Steps:

1. **Define Edge Nodes**:
   - Create a simple structure for edge nodes that can process data.
   ```python
   class EdgeNode:
       def __init__(self, id):
           self.id = id

       def process_data(self, data):
           print(f"Edge Node {self.id} processing data: {data}")
           return data * 2  # Simulated processing
   ```

2. **Simulate Data Collection**:
   - Create a function to collect data from users and send it to the nearest edge node.
   ```python
   def collect_data(user_data, edge_node):
       print(f"Collecting data from user: {user_data}")
       processed_data = edge_node.process_data(user_data)
       print(f"Processed data: {processed_data}")
   ```

3. **Test Edge Computing Application**:
   - Simulate data collection and processing at edge nodes.
   ```python
   edge_node_1 = EdgeNode(1)
   edge_node_2 = EdgeNode(2)

   collect_data(10, edge_node_1)
   collect_data(20, edge_node_2)
   ```

4. **Analyze Performance Benefits**:
   - Compare processing times with central cloud processing.

#### Concepts:
- **Edge Computing**: A computing paradigm that processes data at the edge of the network, closer to the data source.
- **Latency Reduction**: The decrease in response time achieved by processing data closer to the user.
