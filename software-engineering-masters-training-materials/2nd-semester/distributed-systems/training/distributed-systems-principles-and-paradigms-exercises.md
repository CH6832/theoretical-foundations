### **Self-Management in Distributed Systems**

#### 1. **Feedback Control Simulation**
   - Implement a basic feedback control system using Python. Simulate a distributed web server that automatically adjusts the number of server instances based on user load (e.g., by monitoring CPU usage). You can simulate incoming traffic using random numbers.

#### 2. **Astrolabe-Style Monitoring**
   - Build a simple distributed system with three nodes. Create a script that collects resource utilization (CPU, memory) from each node, aggregates it at a central node, and generates a summary. This simulates the monitoring approach used by Astrolabe.

#### 3. **Replication Strategy Comparison**
   - Using **Globule-like** strategies, create a program that simulates two replication approaches: one with full content replication to all nodes and one with selective replication. Measure performance (response times, bandwidth) based on simulated user requests to demonstrate the impact of each strategy.

#### 4. **Automatic Repair in Distributed Systems**
   - Implement a simple system where services (represented by processes) fail randomly. Write a script that monitors the services and automatically restarts them when they fail, simulating **Jadeâ€™s automatic repair system**.

### **Processes and Threads in Distributed Systems**

#### 5. **Multi-threaded Server**
   - Build a basic multi-threaded TCP server in Python. Each thread should handle one client connection. Test this with multiple clients connecting simultaneously to understand how threads work in distributed systems.

#### 6. **Parallel Data Processing with Threads**
   - Write a program to parallelize a computation task (e.g., calculating large prime numbers or matrix multiplication) using Python's threading library. Analyze the performance improvement from using threads versus sequential processing.

#### 7. **Thread Synchronization**
   - Implement a producer-consumer problem using threads where one thread produces data (e.g., numbers) and another thread consumes it. Use synchronization primitives (like semaphores or locks) to avoid race conditions.

### **Virtualization in Distributed Systems**

#### 8. **Set up a Virtual Machine**
   - Install a hypervisor like **VirtualBox** or **VMware** and create a virtual machine. Install a different operating system (e.g., Linux) on the virtual machine and explore resource management features such as CPU allocation and memory limits.

#### 9. **Docker Containerization**
   - Use **Docker** to containerize a small web application (e.g., a Python Flask app). Run the container on your local machine, and explore how containerization improves deployment flexibility and resource isolation compared to traditional VM-based approaches.

#### 10. **Performance Comparison: VM vs. Container**
   - Set up a virtual machine and a Docker container on the same physical machine. Run a computational task (like a stress test) in both environments and compare the performance (CPU usage, memory, etc.) to observe the overhead differences between full virtualization and containerization.

### **Clients in Distributed Systems**

#### 11. **Build a Networked User Interface**
   - Create a simple web client (using HTML/JavaScript or Python) that interacts with a distributed server. Simulate a distributed file storage system where the client can upload/download files to/from the server.

#### 12. **Implement Client-Side Caching**
   - Build a client-server system where the client implements caching (e.g., file or data caching). Demonstrate how caching can reduce network traffic and improve response times by fetching frequently accessed data locally.

### **Servers in Distributed Systems**

#### 13. **Design a Concurrent Web Server**
   - Write a basic concurrent web server in Python that handles multiple client requests simultaneously using threading or asynchronous I/O. Simulate heavy load by sending multiple requests at once and observe how the server handles concurrency.

#### 14. **Server Load Balancing Simulation**
   - Implement a simple load balancer that distributes incoming requests between multiple server instances. Simulate a scenario where the load balancer distributes requests evenly across servers and analyze how this approach improves performance and availability.

#### 15. **Fault Tolerance in Server Clusters**
   - Build a small system of multiple server processes (simulating a cluster) where each server can handle a portion of incoming client requests. Simulate server failures and implement a mechanism to redirect traffic from failed servers to available ones, ensuring the system remains functional.

### **Code Migration in Distributed Systems**

#### 16. **Basic Code Migration Simulation**
   - Simulate a code migration process by writing a script that transfers code (e.g., Python scripts) between two machines and executes it on the remote machine. Use SSH to automate the transfer and execution. 

#### 17. **Serverless Computing Simulation**
   - Implement a basic version of **serverless computing** where code (e.g., a Python function) is deployed and executed based on specific events (e.g., a user request). Use a local event-driven architecture to trigger function execution.

#### 18. **Code Migration in Heterogeneous Environments**
   - Write a program that uses Docker to run a Python script on different operating systems (e.g., Linux and Windows). Migrate the code between two containers running different operating systems and observe how Docker handles this migration.

---

### **Additional Practical Exercises**

#### 19. **Service Monitoring and Alert System**
   - Implement a service monitoring system that periodically checks the health of multiple distributed services (e.g., HTTP response time, CPU usage) and sends alerts (e.g., email notifications) if a service goes down.

#### 20. **Distributed Database Simulation**
   - Create a simple distributed database system where data is partitioned across multiple nodes. Write a client that can query data from these nodes transparently, and simulate failure scenarios where data must be retrieved from backup nodes.

### Exercise Details

1. **Simulating Feedback Control (Exercise 1)**: You can implement this by creating a system that measures resource utilization every few seconds and adjusts the number of server instances based on a set threshold.
   
2. **Astrolabe-Style Monitoring (Exercise 2)**: Use tools like Python's `psutil` to collect system stats. Create a hierarchy where one central node collects summaries from two other nodes.

3. **Replication Strategies (Exercise 3)**: Simulate users requesting content and measure the response time based on full vs. selective replication. Use different file sizes to show the trade-offs in performance.

4. **Automatic Repair (Exercise 4)**: Use Python to manage a list of service processes and their statuses. When a service crashes, automatically restart it and log the repair.
