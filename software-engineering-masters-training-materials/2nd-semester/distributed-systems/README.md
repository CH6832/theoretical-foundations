# Distributed Systems

## Course Overview
This course covers the principles and practices of distributed systems, including system design, communication protocols, and fault tolerance.

## Course Content
1. **Introduction to Distributed Systems**
   - Models and assumptions
   - Message-passing vs shared memory
   - Client-server and peer-to-peer architectures

2. **Consensus Algorithms**
   - Leader election
   - Paxos, Raft, Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT)

3. **Distributed Data Storage**
   - Consistency models (Strong, eventual consistency)
   - Distributed hash tables
   - Data replication and consistency protocols (Quorum-based)

4. **Fault Tolerance and Reliability**
   - Failover techniques
   - Partition tolerance, load balancing

5. **Security in Distributed Systems**
   - Secure communication (TLS, SSL)
   - Distributed authentication and authorization
   
## Assessment
- Distributed systems design project
- Midterm and final exams
- Lab assignments using distributed frameworks (e.g., Apache Kafka, Zookeeper)

## Resources
- "Distributed Systems: Principles and Paradigms" by Andrew Tanenbaum
- Research papers on consensus and distributed storage systems
