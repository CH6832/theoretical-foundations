### **Practical Exercises**

---

### **Exercise 1: Identifying Cloud Service Models**
Research popular cloud service providers (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure) and classify at least **three services** they offer under the categories of **IaaS (Infrastructure-as-a-Service), PaaS (Platform-as-a-Service), and SaaS (Software-as-a-Service)**. Provide real-world use cases for each.

- **Goal:** Understand the different cloud service models and how they are applied.

---

### **Exercise 2: Compare On-Premise vs. Cloud Infrastructure**
Using a business scenario (e.g., running a web application), compare the **costs, scalability, and maintenance** of running the application on-premise versus hosting it on the cloud. Use specific examples of hardware, software, and cloud services.

- **Goal:** Highlight the advantages and disadvantages of cloud infrastructure compared to traditional on-premise setups.

---

### **Exercise 3: Create a Cloud Budget**
Assume you are planning to host a simple e-commerce website on a cloud provider. Research and create a **cloud infrastructure budget** that includes the costs of virtual machines, storage, and data transfer for a **3-month period**. Use services like AWS or Google Cloud pricing calculators.

- **Goal:** Get hands-on experience with pricing and budgeting cloud services.

---

### **Exercise 4: Horizontal vs. Vertical Scaling Example**
Write a brief scenario where an organization needs to scale its resources due to high demand (e.g., a spike in traffic during a holiday sale). Provide two solutions: one that uses **horizontal scaling** and one that uses **vertical scaling**. Discuss the pros and cons of each approach.

- **Goal:** Understand the practical differences between horizontal and vertical scaling in cloud environments.

---

### **Exercise 5: Cloud Security Challenge**
Identify three potential **security risks** in cloud computing and propose a strategy to mitigate each risk. Consider issues like data breaches, access control, and encryption.

- **Goal:** Analyze cloud security vulnerabilities and think critically about risk management strategies.

---

### **Exercise 6: Cloud Migration Plan**
Outline a **migration plan** for moving a company’s on-premise database to the cloud. Include the steps for data transfer, minimizing downtime, and ensuring data integrity. Consider factors like vendor selection and compliance with data regulations.

- **Goal:** Explore the steps involved in cloud migration and the potential challenges.

---

### **Exercise 7: Research Public vs. Private Clouds**
Research and summarize the differences between **public, private, and hybrid cloud** models. Provide examples of companies that might benefit from each model and explain why.

- **Goal:** Understand the unique characteristics and use cases of different cloud deployment models.

---

### **Exercise 8: Evaluate Cloud Mechanisms**
Choose one cloud provider (AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure) and evaluate its **virtualization, storage, and networking** mechanisms. How do these mechanisms support the provider’s cloud services?

- **Goal:** Deepen understanding of the technical mechanisms that enable cloud computing.

---

### **Exercise 9: Real-World Case Study**
Find a real-world case study of a company that successfully implemented cloud computing. Summarize the case, focusing on the **benefits** they achieved (e.g., cost savings, scalability) and any **challenges** they encountered (e.g., security or compliance issues).

- **Goal:** Learn from real-world cloud computing success stories and challenges.

---

### **Exercise 10: Plan a Cloud Architecture**
Design a simple **cloud architecture** for a start-up business. Include elements like servers, storage, databases, load balancing, and security measures. Use any cloud platform (AWS, Azure, GCP) and justify your choices.

- **Goal:** Apply knowledge of cloud architecture to create a practical, scalable solution for a small business.
