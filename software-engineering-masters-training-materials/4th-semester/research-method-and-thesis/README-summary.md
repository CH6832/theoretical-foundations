## Course Content

### **1. Research Methodologies**

#### **Qualitative vs Quantitative Research**

**Concepts:**
- **Qualitative Research:** Exploring phenomena through non-numerical data such as interviews, case studies, and observations.
- **Quantitative Research:** Using numerical data and statistical methods to test hypotheses and analyze relationships.

**Advanced Techniques:**
- **Mixed Methods Research:** Combining qualitative and quantitative approaches to provide a more comprehensive understanding of research problems.
- **Longitudinal Studies:** Conducting research over extended periods to observe changes and developments.

**Python Example (Quantitative Data Analysis):**
```python
# Quantitative data analysis using Python's pandas and matplotlib libraries
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Sample data
data = {'Year': [2020, 2021, 2022], 'Revenue': [1000, 1200, 1400]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Plotting revenue over the years
plt.plot(df['Year'], df['Revenue'], marker='o')
plt.xlabel('Year')
plt.ylabel('Revenue')
plt.title('Revenue Over Years')
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```
This Python script demonstrates how to analyze and visualize quantitative data, which is essential for conducting statistical research.

#### **Experimental Design and Data Collection**

**Concepts:**
- **Experimental Design:** Planning and structuring experiments to test hypotheses, including control and experimental groups.
- **Data Collection Methods:** Techniques for gathering data, including surveys, experiments, and observations.

**Advanced Techniques:**
- **Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs):** Designing experiments where participants are randomly assigned to different conditions.
- **Data Triangulation:** Using multiple data sources or methods to validate findings and increase reliability.

**Python Example (Simulating an Experiment):**
```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# Simulate experiment data
np.random.seed(0)
control_group = np.random.normal(loc=50, scale=10, size=30)
experimental_group = np.random.normal(loc=55, scale=10, size=30)

# Create DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame({
    'Group': ['Control']*30 + ['Experimental']*30,
    'Score': np.concatenate([control_group, experimental_group])
})

# Calculate and display means
mean_control = df[df['Group'] == 'Control']['Score'].mean()
mean_experimental = df[df['Group'] == 'Experimental']['Score'].mean()

print(f"Mean Score - Control Group: {mean_control}")
print(f"Mean Score - Experimental Group: {mean_experimental}")
```
This script simulates an experiment with control and experimental groups, providing insights into comparing results.

fake = Faker()

# Generating anonymized data
def generate_anonymized_data

(n):
    data = {'Name': [fake.name() for _ in range(n)],
            'Email': [fake.email() for _ in range(n)]}
    return pd.DataFrame(data)

# Create anonymized dataset
df_anonymized = generate_anonymized_data(10)
print(df_anonymized)
```
This example uses the `Faker` library to generate anonymized data, which is crucial for protecting participant identities.
