The focus is on creating scalable, reliable, and efficient solutions to meet organizational needs, integrating various enterprise solutions like ERP and CRM, and ensuring performance and high availability.

## Course Content

### **1. Enterprise Architecture**

#### **Enterprise Architecture Frameworks**

**Concepts:**
- **TOGAF (The Open Group Architecture Framework):** A detailed method and set of supporting tools for developing an enterprise architecture. It provides a systematic approach to design, planning, implementation, and governance of enterprise information architecture.
  - **Architecture Development Method (ADM):** Core of TOGAF, used to design, plan, and implement an enterprise architecture.
  - **Architecture Content Framework:** Provides models and templates for architecture artifacts.

- **Zachman Framework:** A schema for organizing architectural artifacts (models, documents, diagrams) in a structured manner. It classifies artifacts according to different perspectives and layers.

**Advanced Techniques:**
- **Architecture Governance:** Ensuring the adherence to architectural principles and guidelines through regular audits and reviews.
- **Architecture Modeling:** Using UML (Unified Modeling Language) and ArchiMate for visual representation of architecture.

**Java Example (TOGAF-Based Architecture with UML):**
```java
// Define a basic UML class diagram for an enterprise system

// Business Process Interface
public interface BusinessProcess {
    void execute();
}

// OrderProcessing Concrete Implementation
public class OrderProcessing implements BusinessProcess {
    @Override
    public void execute() {
        System.out.println("Processing Order...");
    }
}

// Enterprise System Interface
public interface EnterpriseSystem {
    void startProcess(BusinessProcess process);
}

// ECommerceSystem Concrete Implementation
public class ECommerceSystem implements EnterpriseSystem {
    @Override
    public void startProcess(BusinessProcess process) {
        System.out.println("Starting Process...");
        process.execute();
    }
}

// Main Class for Execution
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        EnterpriseSystem system = new ECommerceSystem();
        BusinessProcess process = new OrderProcessing();
        system.startProcess(process);
    }
}
```

import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

public class ApiGateway {
    private final Map<String, String> services = new HashMap<>();

    public void registerService(String name, String endpoint) {
        services.put(name, endpoint);
        System.out.println("Service Registered: " + name + " at " + endpoint);
    }

    public String getServiceEndpoint(String name) {
        return services.get(name);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ApiGateway gateway = new ApiGateway();
        gateway.registerService("OrderService", "http://orders.example.com");
        System.out.println("OrderService Endpoint: " + gateway.getServiceEndpoint("OrderService"));
    }
}
```

**Java Example (ERP Module Implementation):**
```java
// Basic ERP Module for Managing Inventory
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

public class InventoryManagement {
    private final Map<String, Integer> inventory = new HashMap<>();

    public void addItem(String item, int quantity) {
        inventory.put(item, quantity);
        System.out.println("Added Item: " + item + " with quantity: " + quantity);
    }

    public void checkStock(String item) {
        int quantity = inventory.getOrDefault(item, 0);
        System.out.println("Stock for " + item + ": " + quantity);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        InventoryManagement inv = new InventoryManagement();
        inv.addItem("Laptop", 50);
        inv.checkStock("Laptop");
    }
}
```
