# Programming Paradigms and Functional Programming

## Course Overview
This course explores various programming paradigms with a special focus on functional programming. It covers essential concepts and practical applications of different paradigms.

## Course Content
1. **Introduction to Programming Paradigms**
   - Imperative vs Declarative programming
   - Overview of paradigms (Procedural, OOP, Functional)

2. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
   - Encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism
   - Principles of good object design (SOLID)

3. **Functional Programming Concepts**
   - Pure functions and immutability
   - Higher-order functions
   - Recursion and tail recursion
   - Closures and lambda expressions

4. **Monads and Functors**
   - The Monad pattern
   - Functors, Applicatives
   - Practical examples in Haskell/Scala

5. **Concurrency in Functional Programming**
   - Functional concurrency models (Actors, CSP)
   - Asynchronous programming (Futures, Promises)
   
## Assessment
- Functional programming tasks in Haskell
- Paradigm comparison project
- Final exam
