# What kinds of problems are solved by algorithms?

Algorithms solve a wide range of computational problems, far beyond simple sorting. Practical applications of algorithms are found in numerous fields, including biology, internet technology, commerce, and resource management. Some prominent examples include:

### 1. **Human Genome Project**
The Human Genome Project aims to identify around 30,000 genes in human DNA and determine the sequences of the 3 billion chemical base pairs that make up human DNA. This requires sophisticated algorithms to:
- Store this massive data in databases.
- Develop tools for efficient data analysis.
  
Many of these biological problems are solved using techniques like **dynamic programming**, which helps in determining the similarity between DNA sequences. This leads to savings in human and machine time, as well as financial resources, as it allows more information to be extracted through laboratory techniques.

### 2. **Internet Data Management**
The internet handles vast amounts of data, and algorithms play a crucial role in managing and manipulating this information. Examples include:
- **Routing algorithms**: These help find efficient paths for data to travel across the internet. Algorithms for solving such problems are explored in graph-based methods (Chapter 22).
- **Search engines**: Search algorithms are essential for retrieving relevant information quickly. Techniques for this, such as efficient data retrieval and indexing, are covered in algorithms related to search (Chapters 11 and 32).

### 3. **Electronic Commerce and Cryptography**
Electronic commerce involves the secure exchange of goods and services over the internet, relying on the privacy and security of sensitive information like credit card numbers, passwords, and bank details. Algorithms play a vital role in:
- **Public-key cryptography** and **digital signatures**: These are fundamental for securing online transactions, protecting privacy, and ensuring data integrity. Both rely on numerical algorithms and concepts from number theory, discussed in Chapter 31.

### 4. **Resource Allocation and Optimization**
In business and industry, efficient allocation of scarce resources is critical. Examples of such optimization problems include:
- An oil company determining where to place wells to maximize profits.
- A political campaign allocating advertising funds to increase the likelihood of winning an election.
- Airlines optimizing crew schedules to meet regulations at minimal cost.
- Internet service providers deciding where to place additional infrastructure to improve service.

Many of these problems can be solved by modeling them as **linear programming** problems, which are covered in Chapter 29. Linear programming helps businesses and enterprises maximize efficiency and profitability while adhering to constraints.

### Specific Problems Solved by Algorithms

- **Shortest Path in a Road Map**: Given a road map where the distances between intersections are marked, determining the shortest route between two intersections is a common problem. The number of possible routes can be vast. This problem is modeled as a **graph**, where intersections are vertices, and distances are edge weights. Efficient algorithms to find the shortest path, such as Dijkstra’s algorithm, are discussed in Chapter 22.
  
- **Topological Sorting**: In mechanical design, where parts may depend on other parts, determining the correct order to assemble the parts is crucial. For a design with *n* parts, there are *n!* (factorial) possible orderings. Since factorial growth is exceedingly fast, it’s impractical to check every possible order. This problem can be solved using **topological sorting**, discussed in Chapter 20, which efficiently orders parts based on dependency relationships.

- **Clustering for Medical Diagnosis**: When a doctor needs to determine if an image represents a cancerous tumor or a benign one, they can use clustering algorithms to compare the new image with previously known samples. By analyzing similarities, **clustering algorithms** (discussed in Chapter 33) can help identify whether a tumor is more likely to be cancerous or benign.

- **File Compression**: Compressing large text files efficiently saves storage space. Algorithms such as **LZW compression** search for repeating character sequences, while **Huffman coding** (Chapter 15) uses variable-length bit sequences to represent characters, with more frequent characters encoded by shorter sequences.

### Conclusion

Algorithms are fundamental to solving a diverse range of problems across fields like biology, data management, security, resource optimization, and more. Techniques such as dynamic programming, cryptographic algorithms, linear programming, graph algorithms, and clustering provide efficient solutions to complex problems, saving time, resources, and enabling technological advancements.

For instance:
- **Topological sorting** can solve problems where parts in a system must be ordered based on dependencies, ensuring that each part appears before the parts that use it.
- **Clustering algorithms** help in medical diagnosis by comparing similarities between cancerous and benign tumors, aiding doctors in determining the likelihood of malignancy.
- **File compression algorithms**, such as **LZW compression** and **Huffman coding**, reduce the size of large text files by encoding frequently occurring character sequences with shorter bit sequences.

These algorithms optimize processes and make problem-solving in various domains more efficient and practical.

### 1.1-6
- **Problem with Varying Input Availability**:
  **Problem**: Describe a real-world problem where sometimes the entire input is available before solving, but other times it arrives over time.  
  **Solution**:

    - **Scenario 1**: A restaurant receives a list of reservations for the day, allowing it to plan seating arrangements in advance.
    - **Scenario 2**: An online food delivery system receives orders in real-time, requiring immediate adjustments to delivery schedules and routes. Algorithms like **real-time scheduling** and **greedy algorithms** can help in such dynamic cases.
# Concrete Example: Faster Algorithm vs. Faster Computer

Let’s compare two computers, **Computer A** and **Computer B**, performing the same task of sorting an array of 10 million numbers, but with different algorithms and computational power.

### System Specifications
- **Computer A**: 
  - **Speed**: 10 billion instructions per second (very fast)
  - **Algorithm**: Insertion sort, implemented by an expert programmer in machine language, requiring **2n²** instructions to sort *n* numbers.
  
- **Computer B**:
  - **Speed**: 10 million instructions per second (much slower)
  - **Algorithm**: Merge sort, implemented by an average programmer using a high-level language and inefficient compiler, requiring **50n log n** instructions to sort *n* numbers.

### Sorting 10 Million Numbers

Both computers need to sort an array of 10 million numbers. Here’s how long it takes for each:

- **Computer A (Insertion Sort)**:
  - Insertion sort requires **2n²** instructions.
  - Number of instructions:  
    $2 \times 10^7 \times 10^7 = 2 \times 10^{14} \text{ instructions}$
    
  - Time to execute:  
    $\frac{2 \times 10^{14}}{10^{10} \text{ instructions/sec}} = 20,000 \text{ seconds (over 5.5 hours)}$
    

- **Computer B (Merge Sort)**:
  - Merge sort requires **50n log n** instructions.
  - For 10 million numbers, log₁₀(10⁷) ≈ 23.
  - Number of instructions:  
    $50 \times 10^7 \times 23 = 1.15 \times 10^9 \text{ instructions}$
    
  - Time to execute:  
    $\frac{1.15 \times 10^9}{10^7 \text{ instructions/sec}} = 1163 \text{ seconds (under 20 minutes)}$
    

### Key Observation

Despite **Computer A** being 1000 times faster than **Computer B** in raw computing power, **Computer B** finishes sorting much more quickly. **Computer A** takes over 5.5 hours, while **Computer B** takes under 20 minutes.

### Sorting 100 Million Numbers

Now, let’s examine how the performance scales with 100 million numbers.

- **Computer A (Insertion Sort)**:  
  $2 \times 10^8 \times 10^8 = 2 \times 10^{16} \text{ instructions}$
  
  Time to execute:  
  $\frac{2 \times 10^{16}}{10^{10}} = 2 \times 10^6 \text{ seconds (over 23 days)}$
  

- **Computer B (Merge Sort)**:  
  $50 \times 10^8 \times 26 = 1.3 \times 10^{10} \text{ instructions}$
  
  Time to execute:  
  $\frac{1.3 \times 10^{10}}{10^7} = 1300 \times 10 \times 1 \approx 3600 \text{ seconds (under 4 hours)}$
  

### Conclusion

The difference becomes even more dramatic as the problem size increases. For 100 million numbers:
- **Computer A** (faster but using a slower algorithm) takes **over 23 days**.
- **Computer B** (slower but using a faster algorithm) takes **under 4 hours**.

This illustrates the importance of choosing efficient algorithms. As problem size grows, the **algorithm’s efficiency** often outweighs the **raw computing power**, giving a significant performance advantage. 

In real-world applications where datasets are massive (e.g., web searches, emails, or astronomical data), the **choice of algorithm** can dramatically affect processing time.

# Exercises

### 1.2-1
**Problem**: Give an example of an application that requires algorithmic content at the application level, and discuss the function of the algorithms involved.

**Solution**:  
- **Application**: A **navigation app** (e.g., Google Maps) requires algorithms at the application level to compute the shortest or fastest route between two locations.
- **Algorithms involved**:  
  - **Dijkstra's algorithm** or **A\* search algorithm** is used to find the shortest path in road networks (graph representation).
  - **Heuristic-based optimization** helps predict and reroute based on real-time traffic conditions.
  - **Dynamic programming** can be used to handle toll or time restrictions.

### 1.2-2
**Problem**: Suppose that for inputs of size *n* on a particular computer, insertion sort runs in **8n²** steps and merge sort runs in **64n log n** steps. For which values of *n* does insertion sort beat merge sort?

**Solution**:  
We need to find when the number of steps for insertion sort is less than for merge sort:
$8n^2 < 64n \log n$

Dividing both sides by 8:
$n^2 < 8n \log n$

This inequality can be solved numerically. By testing values of *n*, you can find that insertion sort is faster for **small values** of *n*, approximately **n < 43**. For larger values, merge sort performs better.

### 1.2-3
**Problem**: What is the smallest value of *n* such that an algorithm with a running time of **100n²** runs faster than an algorithm with a running time of **2ⁿ** on the same machine?

**Solution**:  
We need to find the smallest *n* where:
$100n^2 < 2^n$

This can be solved numerically by checking values of *n*. By trial and error, the smallest *n* for which this inequality holds is **n = 15**.

### 1-1: Comparison of Running Times

For each function *f(n)* and time *t* in the following table, determine the largest size *n* of a problem that can be solved in time *t*, assuming the algorithm takes *f(n)* microseconds. Below are the results for different time limits:

| Time      | lg n     | √n     | n       | n lg n  | n²      | n³      | 2ⁿ      | n!      |

- **lg n**: logarithmic time complexity
- **√n**: square-root time complexity
- **n**: linear time complexity
- **n lg n**: linearithmic time complexity
- **n²**: quadratic time complexity
- **n³**: cubic time complexity
- **2ⁿ**: exponential time complexity

In this table, larger *n* values indicate problems solvable within the specified time limit for a given function *f(n)*. As seen, algorithms with exponential (2ⁿ) or factorial (n!) complexity quickly become infeasible for large problem sizes.

# Exercises

### 2.1-1: Insertion Sort Operation

**Problem**: Using Figure 2.2 as a model, illustrate the operation of **INSERTION-SORT** on an array initially containing the sequence $( \langle 31, 41, 59, 26, 41, 58 \rangle )$.

**Solution**: The insertion sort algorithm works by building a sorted array incrementally, starting with the first element, and inserting each subsequent element into its correct position.

Here’s how **INSERTION-SORT** operates step by step on the array:

1. **Initial array**:  
   $\langle 31, 41, 59, 26, 41, 58 \rangle$
   

2. **Step 1 (Insert 41)**:  
   - 41 is already greater than 31, so no changes are needed.  
   $\langle 31, 41, 59, 26, 41, 58 \rangle$
   

3. **Step 2 (Insert 59)**:  
   - 59 is greater than 41, so no changes are needed.  
   $\langle 31, 41, 59, 26, 41, 58 \rangle$
   

4. **Step 3 (Insert 26)**:  
   - Move 26 to the correct position, shifting 59, 41, and 31 to the right.  
   $\langle 26, 31, 41, 59, 41, 58 \rangle$
   

5. **Step 4 (Insert 41)**:  
   - The second 41 is placed after the first 41. No shifts needed.  
   $\langle 26, 31, 41, 41, 59, 58 \rangle$
   

6. **Step 5 (Insert 58)**:  
   - Move 58 to its correct position by shifting 59.  
   $\langle 26, 31, 41, 41, 58, 59 \rangle$
   

**Final sorted array**:  
$\langle 26, 31, 41, 41, 58, 59 \rangle$


### 2.1-2: Loop Invariant for SUM-ARRAY

**Problem**: Consider the procedure **SUM-ARRAY** which computes the sum of the *n* numbers in array $( A[1..n] )$. State a loop invariant for this procedure, and use its **initialization**, **maintenance**, and **termination** properties to show that **SUM-ARRAY** returns the sum of the numbers in $( A[1..n] )$.

**Procedure**:

```python
SUM-ARRAY(A, n):
    sum = 0
    for i = 1 to n:
        sum = sum + A[i]
    return sum
```

**Loop Invariant**:  
At the start of each iteration of the loop, the variable `sum` contains the sum of the elements $( A[1..i-1] )$.

#### Initialization
- Before the first iteration (`i = 1`), `sum = 0`.
- This correctly represents the sum of the empty subarray $( A[1..0] )$, which is 0.  
Thus, the loop invariant holds before the loop starts.

#### Maintenance
- During each iteration, the current element $( A[i] )$is added to `sum`.
- If the loop invariant holds at the start of iteration *i*, then after adding $( A[i] )$to `sum`, it correctly represents the sum of elements $( A[1..i] )$.
- Therefore, the loop invariant is maintained at each iteration.

#### Termination
- When the loop terminates (i.e., when $( i = n+1 )$), the loop invariant implies that `sum` contains the sum of all elements $( A[1..n] )$.
- At this point, the procedure returns `sum`, which is the correct sum of the array elements.

Thus, the **SUM-ARRAY** procedure correctly computes the sum of the numbers in the array $( A[1..n] )$.

# Exercises

### 2.1-3: Insertion Sort for Monotonically Decreasing Order

**Problem**: Rewrite the **INSERTION-SORT** procedure to sort an array into **monotonically decreasing** order instead of monotonically increasing order.

**Solution**: Insertion sort can be modified by changing the comparison operator to sort in descending order.

Here’s the pseudocode:

```python
INSERTION-SORT-DESC(A):
    for j = 2 to length(A):
        key = A[j]
        # Insert A[j] into the sorted sequence A[1..j-1]
        i = j - 1
        while i > 0 and A[i] < key:
            A[i + 1] = A[i]
            i = i - 1
        A[i + 1] = key
```

This modified version of **INSERTION-SORT** will place the largest element first, continuing to insert elements in decreasing order by using the comparison `A[i] < key`.

---

### 2.1-4: Linear Search

**Problem**: Consider the searching problem where the input is a sequence of *n* numbers $( \langle a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n \rangle )$ stored in array $( A[1..n] )$, and a value $( x )$. The output should be an index $( i )$ such that $( x = A[i] )$, or NIL if $( x )$ does not appear in $( A )$.

**Pseudocode for Linear Search**:

```python
LINEAR-SEARCH(A, n, x):
    for i = 1 to n:
        if A[i] == x:
            return i
    return NIL
```

**Loop Invariant**: At the start of each iteration of the loop, the value $( x )$ has not been found in the first $( i-1 )$ elements of the array.

- **Initialization**: Before the first iteration (`i = 1`), the subarray $( A[1..0] )$ is empty, so $( x )$ has not been found in this subarray.
- **Maintenance**: If the loop invariant is true before iteration *i*, and $( x )$ is not equal to $( A[i] )$, then after iteration *i*, $( x )$ still has not been found in the first *i* elements.
- **Termination**: The loop terminates when either $( x = A[i] )$ is found, returning the index $( i )$, or after all elements have been checked and $( x )$ is not found, returning `NIL`.

Thus, the algorithm is correct based on the loop invariant.

---

### 2.1-5: Adding Two n-bit Binary Integers

**Problem**: Add two *n*-bit binary integers *a* and *b*, stored in two *n*-element arrays $( A[0..n-1] )$ and $( B[0..n-1] )$. The sum $( c = a + b )$ should be stored in an $( (n+1) )$-element array $( C[0..n] )$.

**Procedure for Adding Binary Integers**:

```python
ADD-BINARY-INTEGERS(A, B, n):
    carry = 0
    for i = 0 to n-1:
        C[i] = (A[i] + B[i] + carry) % 2
        carry = (A[i] + B[i] + carry) // 2
    C[n] = carry
    return C
```

- **Explanation**:
  - Iterate over the bits of arrays $( A )$ and $( B )$.
  - For each bit $( i )$, calculate the sum of $( A[i] )$, $( B[i] )$, and the carry from the previous position.
  - Store the result's least significant bit in $( C[i] )$ and update the carry for the next bit.
  - After the loop, store the final carry in $( C[n] )$.

This algorithm correctly adds two binary integers bit by bit, handling carries between bit positions.

## Analyzing Algorithms

### RAM Model of Computation

The RAM (Random Access Machine) model provides a simplified view of computer operations to analyze algorithms. Key aspects of the RAM model include:

- **Sequential Execution**: Instructions execute one after another without concurrent operations.
- **Uniform Time for Instructions**: Each instruction and data access takes a constant amount of time.
- **Data Types**: Includes integers, floating-point numbers, and characters. Boolean values are often tested via integer values (0 for FALSE, non-zero for TRUE).

**Note**: The RAM model assumes a constant time for basic operations such as arithmetic, data movement, and control instructions. This simplification aids in understanding algorithm efficiency without delving into complex hardware specifics.

### Address Computation in RAM

In the RAM model:
- Array elements are stored in contiguous memory locations.
- Address computation involves:
  - Subtraction (if the array is not zero-indexed)
  - Multiplication (or a shift operation if the element size is a power of 2)
  - Addition (often optimized by compilers for sequential array access)

### Handling of Larger Data Sizes

- **Word Size**: Assumed to be sufficient to hold the value of *n* (input size), which is crucial for indexing array elements.
- **Bit Operations**: Operations such as shifting bits are assumed to be constant-time, though this can vary in real hardware.

### Limitations of the RAM Model

- **Memory Hierarchy**: The RAM model does not account for memory hierarchies like caches or virtual memory, which can impact real-world performance.
- **Complex Instructions**: Some operations, like exponentiation, may not strictly adhere to constant-time assumptions, though certain cases (e.g., powers of 2) are simplified.

### Analyzing Insertion Sort

To analyze the **INSERTION-SORT** algorithm:

**Insertion Sort Analysis**:
1. **Basic Operation**: Inserts elements into a sorted subarray by shifting elements as needed.
2. **Time Complexity**:
   - **Worst-Case**: $( O(n^2) )$ where *n* is the number of elements. This occurs when every insertion requires shifting all previously sorted elements.
   - **Best-Case**: $( O(n) )$ when the array is already sorted, and each insertion requires no shifting.

**Example Analysis**:
To determine the time complexity of **INSERTION-SORT**:
- **Worst-Case**: For an array of size *n*, it requires $( O(n^2) )$ operations.
- **Empirical Testing**: To verify the time complexity, you can run **INSERTION-SORT** on different input sizes and measure execution time, comparing it with the theoretical complexity.

### Summary

The RAM model provides a framework to analyze algorithms under idealized conditions. While it simplifies certain aspects of computation, such as ignoring memory hierarchies and assuming constant-time operations, it remains a valuable tool for understanding and predicting algorithm performance. Advanced models and real-world performance considerations can build on this basic understanding to address more complex scenarios.

## Analyzing Algorithms

### Introduction to Algorithm Analysis

When evaluating algorithms, it is essential to understand the underlying technology and resources they utilize. Most algorithm analysis relies on the **Random Access Machine (RAM)** model, a simplified representation of real-world computing environments. This model helps us focus on algorithm efficiency without getting bogged down by hardware specifics.

### RAM Model Overview

1. **Execution Model**: 
   - **Sequential Execution**: Instructions are executed one after another without concurrent operations.
   - **Constant Time**: Each instruction and data access takes the same amount of time.

2. **Data Types**:
   - **Integer**: For whole numbers.
   - **Floating Point**: For real-number approximations.
   - **Character**: For text representation.
   - **Boolean Values**: Often represented as integer values (0 for FALSE, non-zero for TRUE).

3. **Instructions**:
   - **Arithmetic Operations**: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, etc.
   - **Data Movement**: Loading, storing, copying data.
   - **Control Operations**: Branching, subroutine calls, returns.

### Address Computation

- **Memory Addressing**: 
  - Arrays are stored in contiguous memory locations.
  - Address computation involves:
    - **Subtraction** (for non-zero-indexed arrays)
    - **Multiplication** (often simplified to shift operations for power-of-2 sizes)
    - **Addition** (optimized for sequential array access)

### RAM Model Assumptions

- **Word Size**: Sufficient to hold values of size *n*, with constant size to prevent unrealistic scenarios.
- **Constant-Time Operations**: Simplified assumption for operations like bit shifting and multiplication, as long as results fit within the word size.

### Limitations of the RAM Model

- **Memory Hierarchies**: The RAM model does not account for complexities like caches or virtual memory, which can impact real performance.
- **Complex Instructions**: Some operations, such as exponentiation, might not always be constant-time in practical scenarios.

### Practical Considerations

- **Empirical Testing**: While theoretical models provide a baseline, real-world testing is crucial for understanding actual performance on specific hardware.
- **Algorithm Efficiency**: The RAM model is a good starting point, but additional models may be needed to address real-world performance issues, including memory hierarchies and hardware-specific optimizations.

### Summary

The RAM model offers a foundational framework for analyzing algorithms by simplifying assumptions about instruction execution and data handling.

## 2.2 Analyzing Algorithms

### Word Size and Constant Time

In the RAM model, we assume integers are represented by $( c \log_2 n )$ bits, where $( c \geq 1 )$. This ensures that:

- **Word Size**: Each word can hold values up to $( n )$, allowing us to index individual elements without arbitrary growth in word size.
- **Constant Time Operations**: If word size could grow arbitrarily, storing large amounts of data in one word and operating on it in constant time would be unrealistic. To avoid this, we restrict $( c )$ to a constant.

### Gray Areas in the RAM Model

The RAM model simplifies certain operations, but real computers have instructions that may not fit neatly into this model:

- **Exponentiation**: Computing $( x^n )$ generally takes time logarithmic in $( n )$ (see equation (31.34) on page 934). If $( n )$ is a power of 2, exponentiation can often be treated as a constant-time operation due to specific hardware optimizations.
- **Bit Shifting**: Many computers support a "shift left" instruction, which shifts the bits of an integer by $( n )$ positions in constant time. This operation effectively multiplies the integer by $( 2^n )$. Such operations are often treated as constant time in the RAM model if the result fits within a computer word.

### Memory Hierarchy and Practical Models

- **Memory Hierarchy**: The RAM model does not account for memory hierarchy effects like caches or virtual memory, which can significantly impact real-world performance.
- **Complex Models**: Models that include memory hierarchy are more complex and can be challenging to work with. However, RAM-model analyses generally provide a good approximation of performance on actual hardware.

### Analyzing Algorithm Complexity

Analyzing algorithms within the RAM model is usually straightforward, but can become challenging when:

- **Mathematical Tools**: You may need to use combinatorics, probability theory, and algebraic skills to understand algorithm behavior and performance.
- **Input Variability**: Algorithms might behave differently for various inputs. Summarizing this behavior requires creating clear, easily understood formulas.

### Example: Insertion Sort Analysis

To determine the performance of the `INSERTION-SORT` algorithm, one approach is empirical testing by running the algorithm on your computer and measuring execution time. This practical approach helps you understand how the algorithm performs in real-world scenarios, beyond theoretical analysis.

## Analyzing Algorithm Performance

### Empirical Timing

Implementing `INSERTION-SORT` in a real programming language and timing it on a specific computer provides practical insights into its performance. However, the timing results depend on several factors:

- **Computer Specifications**: Processor speed, memory, and other hardware characteristics.
- **Implementation Details**: Compiler or interpreter used, libraries linked, and the specific coding practices.
- **Background Tasks**: Other processes running on the computer that might affect performance.
- **Input Variability**: Different inputs can result in varying execution times.

Given these variables, empirical timing on one computer might not generalize well to other systems or inputs. Therefore, while timing tests offer practical insights, they are limited in their ability to predict performance under different conditions.

### Theoretical Analysis

Instead of relying solely on empirical testing, we can analyze the algorithm itself to predict its performance more broadly. This involves:

1. **Counting Operations**: Determine how many times each line of pseudocode executes and how long each operation takes.
2. **Formulating Running Time**: Develop a precise but potentially complex formula for the running time based on the operations and input size.

### Key Concepts in Analysis

- **Input Size**: The size of the input often has the greatest effect on running time. For sorting algorithms like insertion sort, the input size is typically the number of items being sorted. For other problems, such as integer multiplication, the input size might be measured in bits.
  
- **Running Time Cases**:
  - **Worst-case**: The maximum time an algorithm takes for any input of a given size.
  - **Best-case**: The minimum time an algorithm takes for the most favorable input of a given size.
  - **Average-case**: The expected time an algorithm takes, averaged over all possible inputs of a given size.

### Example: Insertion Sort

**Insertion Sort**'s performance varies with input size and order. To understand its performance:

1. **Define Terms**:
   - **Running Time**: Time it takes to sort an array of size $( n )$.
   - **Input Size**: Number of items in the array.

2. **Analyze Running Time**:
   - **Worst-Case**: Occurs when the input is in reverse order. The running time is $( O(n^2) )$.
   - **Best-Case**: Occurs when the input is already sorted. The running time is $( O(n) )$.
   - **Average-Case**: Typically analyzed with the assumption of random order, resulting in a running time of $( O(n^2) )$.

### Summary

While empirical testing provides insights into specific scenarios, theoretical analysis offers a more general understanding of an algorithm's performance. By focusing on how the running time scales with input size and different types of inputs, we can make more informed comparisons between algorithms and better predict their behavior in various contexts.

To analyze the running time of the `INSERTION-SORT` algorithm, we need to account for the number of times each statement is executed and the time cost associated with each execution. Here's a detailed breakdown:

### Insertion Sort Pseudocode
```plaintext
INSERTION-SORT(A)
1 for i = 2 to length(A)
2     key = A[i]
3     j = i - 1
4     while j > 0 and A[j] > key
5         A[j + 1] = A[j]
6         j = j - 1
7     A[j + 1] = key
```

### Analyzing Running Time

#### Time Costs of Statements
Assume each line of pseudocode has a constant time cost:
- Line 1: `for` loop initialization and update: cost = `c1`
- Line 2: Assignment `key = A[i]`: cost = `c2`
- Line 3: Assignment `j = i - 1`: cost = `c3`
- Line 4: `while` loop test: cost = `c4`
- Line 5: Assignment `A[j + 1] = A[j]`: cost = `c5`
- Line 6: Update `j = j - 1`: cost = `c6`
- Line 7: Assignment `A[j + 1] = key`: cost = `c7`

#### Number of Executions
- **Line 1**: The `for` loop runs `n - 1` times, where `n` is the length of the array.
- **Line 2**: Executes once per iteration of the `for` loop, so `n - 1` times.
- **Line 3**: Executes once per iteration of the `for` loop, so `n - 1` times.
- **Line 4**: The `while` loop condition is checked up to `i` times for each value of `i`. Thus, the number of times this line is executed is dependent on the number of iterations of the `while` loop.
- **Line 5**: Executes each time the `while` loop body runs.
- **Line 6**: Executes each time the `while` loop body runs.
- **Line 7**: Executes once per `for` loop iteration.

Let $( t_i )$ be the number of times the `while` loop test (Line 4) is executed for a specific value of $( i )$. For a given $( i )$, the number of iterations of the `while` loop is up to $( i - 1 )$, so $( t_i )$ can be at most $( i - 1 )$. 

### Total Running Time Calculation

To compute the total running time $( T(n) )$ of `INSERTION-SORT`:

- The `for` loop executes `n - 1` times:
  - Line 1: Cost = $( c1 \times (n - 1) )$
  - Line 2: Cost = $( c2 \times (n - 1) )$
  - Line 3: Cost = $( c3 \times (n - 1) )$

- For each `i`, the `while` loop test (Line 4) and loop body (Lines 5 and 6) depend on the value of $( i )$. In the worst case, the `while` loop executes $( i - 1 )$ times for each `i`:
  - Total number of executions of Line 4 (test) across all `i` is:
    $  \sum_{i=2}^{n} (i - 1) = \frac{(n - 1) \cdot n}{2}
$
  - Total number of executions of Line 5 and Line 6 is the same as Line 4:
    $  \frac{(n - 1) \cdot n}{2}
$

- Line 7 executes `n - 1` times.

Summing up all contributions:
$T(n) = c1 \cdot (n - 1) + c2 \cdot (n - 1) + c3 \cdot (n - 1) + (c4 + c5 + c6) \cdot \frac{(n - 1) \cdot n}{2} + c7 \cdot (n - 1)
\]

### Simplified Asymptotic Analysis

For large $( n )$, the dominant term is the one with the highest growth rate. In this case, the dominant term is:
$\frac{(n - 1) \cdot n}{2}
\]
Thus, the running time $( T(n) )$ of `INSERTION-SORT` is $( O(n^2) )$ in the worst case.

In summary, while the exact running time involves constants and lower-order terms, the asymptotic notation $( O(n^2) )$ provides a clear understanding of how the running time grows as the input size increases.

The analysis of `INSERTION-SORT` illustrates how we can break down the running time of an algorithm into its constituent operations and understand its behavior in different scenarios. Here's a detailed summary and explanation based on the provided information:

### Running Time Calculation

#### Best-Case Running Time

In the best-case scenario, where the array is already sorted:
- **Line 5** (while loop test) is executed only once per `i`, so $( t_i = 1 )$ for $( i = 2, 3, \ldots, n )$.
- The running time $( T(n) )$ is:
  $T(n) = c1 \cdot n + c2 \cdot (n - 1) + c4 \cdot (n - 1) + c5 \cdot (n - 1) + c8 \cdot (n - 1)$
  $= (c1 + c2 + c4 + c5 + c8) \cdot n - (c2 + c4 + c5 + c8)$
  $= a \cdot n - b$
  where $( a = c1 + c2 + c4 + c5 + c8 )$ and $( b = c2 + c4 + c5 + c8 )$.

  This is a linear function of $( n )$, and the running time grows linearly with the size of the input.

#### Worst-Case Running Time

In the worst-case scenario, where the array is sorted in reverse order:
- **Line 5** (while loop test) is executed $( i )$ times for each $( i )$, so $( t_i = i )$ for $( i = 2, 3, \ldots, n )$.
- Total number of times Line 5 is executed is:
  $\sum_{i=2}^{n} i = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} - 1$
- Total number of executions for Lines 6 and 7 is also:
  $\sum_{i=2}^{n} (i - 1) = \frac{n(n - 1)}{2}$
- The worst-case running time $( T(n) )$ is:
  $T(n) = c1 \cdot n + c2 \cdot (n - 1) + c4 \cdot (n - 1) + c5 \cdot \left(\frac{n(n + 1)}{2} - 1\right) + c6 \cdot \frac{n(n - 1)}{2} + c7 \cdot \frac{n(n - 1)}{2} + c8 \cdot (n - 1)$
  $= \left(\frac{c5 + c6 + c7}{2}\right) n^2 + \left(c1 + c2 + c4 + c5/2 - c6/2 - c7/2 + c8\right) n - (c2 + c4 + c5 + c8)$
  $= a \cdot n^2 + b \cdot n + c$
  where:
  - $( a = \frac{c5 + c6 + c7}{2} )$
  - $( b = c1 + c2 + c4 + \frac{c5}{2} - \frac{c6}{2} - \frac{c7}{2} + c8 )$
  - $( c = -(c2 + c4 + c5 + c8) )$

  This is a quadratic function of $( n )$, and the running time grows quadratically with the size of the input.

### Worst-Case and Average-Case Analysis

The worst-case running time analysis provides a guarantee of the maximum time the algorithm will take on any input of size $( n )$. This is crucial in real-time computing and performance-critical applications.

#### Average-Case Analysis

- In addition to worst-case analysis, average-case analysis is important as it provides insight into the algorithm’s performance over a range of typical inputs.
- For `INSERTION-SORT`, the average-case analysis often shows that the algorithm performs better than the worst-case scenario but is still $( O(n^2) )$ in complexity.

#### Practical Implications

- Knowing the worst-case running time helps in scenarios where guarantees are required, but in many practical applications, average-case performance and real-world factors might be more relevant.
- Insertion sort is a good example of an algorithm where the worst-case performance is quadratic, making it less suitable for large datasets. For larger inputs, more efficient algorithms like merge sort or quicksort, which have better average-case and worst-case performances, are typically preferred.

By understanding these aspects, you can make informed choices about which sorting algorithm to use based on the specific requirements and constraints of your application.

Here’s a detailed breakdown of the provided exercises and problems:

### Exercises

#### 2.2-1: Expressing a Function in Θ-Notation

**Function:** $( f(n) = \frac{n^3}{1000} + 100n^2 - 100n + 3 )$

**To express this in Θ-notation:**

- The dominant term is $( \frac{n^3}{1000} )$. 
- As $( n )$ becomes large, this term will overshadow the $( 100n^2 )$, $( -100n )$, and constant $( 3 )$ terms.

Thus, in Θ-notation, the function simplifies to:
$f(n) = Θ(n^3) \]

#### 2.2-2: Selection Sort Analysis

**Pseudocode for Selection Sort:**

```plaintext
SELECTION-SORT(A, n)
1 for i = 1 to n-1
2     minIndex = i
3     for j = i+1 to n
4         if A[j] < A[minIndex]
5             minIndex = j
6     swap A[i] with A[minIndex]
```

**Loop Invariant:**

The algorithm maintains that after each pass of the outer loop (i.e., for index `i`), the subarray `A[1..i-1]` contains the smallest `i-1` elements of the array, in sorted order.

**Why the first `n-1` elements:**

- After finding the smallest element for each position from `1` to `n-1`, the last element is already in its correct position, so no need to process it.

**Worst-Case Running Time:**

- The selection sort algorithm always performs $( n(n-1)/2 )$ comparisons regardless of the input configuration.
- Thus, in Θ-notation, the worst-case running time is $( Θ(n^2) )$.
- The best-case running time is also $( Θ(n^2) )$ because the number of comparisons does not change with the initial ordering of the array.

#### 2.2-3: Linear Search Analysis

**Average-Case:**

- On average, the element being searched is located in the middle of the array. So, approximately $( n/2 )$ elements need to be checked.
  
**Worst-Case:**

- In the worst case, all $( n )$ elements need to be checked.

**Θ-Notation for Linear Search:**

- Average-case: $( Θ(n) )$
- Worst-case: $( Θ(n) )$

#### 2.2-4: Improving Sorting Algorithm’s Best-Case Running Time

To achieve a good best-case running time for a sorting algorithm:

- For algorithms like insertion sort, which already have a good best-case scenario (linear time), this is not always applicable.
- For comparison-based sorting algorithms, consider hybrid algorithms like Timsort, which use insertion sort for small subarrays and more complex sorting algorithms for larger ones.

**Θ-Notation of Linear Search:** This exercise is already covered in Exercise 2.2-3.

### Problems

#### 2-1: Modified Merge Sort

**a. Sorting Sublists with Insertion Sort:**

- Sorting `n/k` sublists, each of length `k`, using insertion sort:
- Time complexity for sorting each sublist of length `k` is $( Θ(k^2) )$.
- Total time for `n/k` sublists is $( Θ((n/k) \cdot k^2) = Θ(n \cdot k) )$.

**b. Merging Sublists:**

- Merging `n/k` sublists into a single sorted list requires:
- Merging takes $( Θ(n \cdot \log(n/k)) )$ time.

**c. Largest `k` for the Same Running Time:**

- Standard merge sort runs in $( Θ(n \log n) )$.
- Modified merge sort runs in $( Θ(nk + n \log(n/k)) )$.
  
  Set:
  $nk + n \log(n/k) = n \log n$
  
  Solving for `k`:
  $nk = n \log n - n \log(n/k)$
  $nk = n \log k$
  $k = \log n$

  Thus, the largest value for `k` is approximately $( Θ(\log n) )$.

**d. Practical Choice of `k`:**

- In practice, `k` should be chosen to balance the overhead of sorting small subarrays with insertion sort and merging cost.
- Empirically, `k` is often chosen to be small enough to ensure the insertion sort is efficient and large enough to minimize the number of merge operations.

This completes the analysis for the provided exercises and problems.

Here’s a detailed solution to the problems and exercises you listed:

### 2-2 Correctness of Bubblesort

#### a. Proving Bubblesort Correctness

To prove that BUBBLESORT is correct, you need to show two things:
1. **Termination**: The algorithm completes after a finite number of steps.
2. **Sorted Array**: After execution, the array $( A )$ is sorted.

**Additional Proof Required:**

- To show that the array is sorted, you need to prove that after the algorithm terminates, $( A[1] \leq A[2] \leq \ldots \leq A[n] )$.

#### b. Loop Invariant for Inner Loop

**Loop Invariant:**
At the start of each iteration of the inner loop (lines 2–4), the subarray $( A[i \text{ to } n] )$ is in a state such that the largest element in $( A[i \text{ to } n] )$ is in position $( n )$.

**Proof:**
1. **Initialization**: Before the first iteration, no elements are sorted, so the invariant trivially holds because no largest element has been placed.
2. **Maintenance**: Assume the invariant holds at the start of an iteration. During each iteration, adjacent elements are compared and swapped if out of order, ensuring the largest element in the current range moves to the end of the subarray.
3. **Termination**: When $( i = n - 1 )$, the largest element in the initial subarray has been moved to position $( n )$. As $( i )$ progresses, more elements are sorted. Thus, at the end of the outer loop, the array is sorted.

#### c. Loop Invariant for Outer Loop

**Loop Invariant:**
At the start of each iteration of the outer loop (lines 1–3), the subarray $( A[1 \text{ to } i-1] )$ is sorted and contains the smallest $( i-1 )$ elements.

**Proof:**
1. **Initialization**: Before the first iteration, $( i = 1 )$, and $( A[1 \text{ to } i-1] )$ is empty, which is trivially sorted.
2. **Maintenance**: During each iteration, the inner loop places the largest unsorted element in its correct position, thereby extending the sorted portion of the array.
3. **Termination**: When $( i = n )$, the entire array has been processed, and $( A[1 \text{ to } n] )$ is sorted.

#### d. Worst-Case Running Time of BUBBLESORT

**Running Time:**
- The outer loop runs $( n-1 )$ times.
- The inner loop runs decreasingly from $( n-1 )$ to 1 times.

Total number of comparisons is:
$\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} i = \frac{(n-1) \cdot n}{2} \]

Thus, the worst-case running time of BUBBLESORT is $( Θ(n^2) )$.

**Comparison with Insertion Sort:**

- Both BUBBLESORT and INSERTION-SORT have a worst-case running time of $( Θ(n^2) )$. However, INSERTION-SORT usually performs better in practice due to fewer swaps.

### 2-3 Correctness of Horner’s Rule

#### a. Running Time of HORNER

**Running Time:**
- The for loop runs $( n + 1 )$ times.
- Each iteration performs constant time operations.

Thus, the running time of HORNER is $( Θ(n) )$.

#### b. Naive Polynomial Evaluation

**Pseudocode for Naive Evaluation:**

```plaintext
NAIVE-EVALUATION(A, n, x)
1 p = 0
2 for i = 0 to n
3     term = A[i]
4     for j = 0 to i-1
5         term = term * x
6     p = p + term
7 return p
```

**Running Time:**
- The inner loop runs $( i )$ times for each iteration of the outer loop.
- Total time is:
  $\sum_{i=0}^{n} i = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}$
  Thus, the running time is $( Θ(n^2) )$.

**Comparison with HORNER:**
- HORNER is $( Θ(n) )$, making it more efficient than the naive method, which is $( Θ(n^2) )$.

#### c. Loop Invariant for HORNER

**Loop Invariant:**
At the start of each iteration of the for loop in lines 2–4, $( p )$ contains:
$p = \sum_{k=i+1}^{n} A[k] \cdot x^{k-i-1}
\]

**Proof:**
1. **Initialization**: Before the first iteration, $( i = n )$, so $( p = A[n] \cdot x^0 )$ which is correct.
2. **Maintenance**: In each iteration, $( A[i] )$ is processed and added to $( p )$ with the correct power of $( x )$, maintaining the invariant.
3. **Termination**: When $( i = -1 )$, $( p )$ contains the entire polynomial evaluation.

### 2-4 Inversions

#### a. List the Inversions

For the array $( [2, 3, 8, 6, 1] )$:
- Inversions: $( (2, 1), (3, 1), (8, 6), (8, 1), (6, 1) )$

#### b. Array with Most Inversions

The array with the most inversions is the reverse sorted array:
$[n, n-1, \ldots, 1] \]

**Number of Inversions:**
- Total inversions in this array are $( \frac{n(n-1)}{2} )$.

#### c. Running Time of Insertion Sort and Number of Inversions

**Relationship:**
- The number of inversions directly affects the running time of insertion sort.
- Insertion sort performs $( Θ(n^2) )$ operations in the worst case, which occurs when the array is in reverse order (maximum inversions).

#### d. Counting Inversions Using Merge Sort

**Algorithm:**

```plaintext
COUNT-INVERSIONS(A, p, r)
1 if p < r
2     q = (p + r) / 2
3     COUNT-INVERSIONS(A, p, q)
4     COUNT-INVERSIONS(A, q + 1, r)
5     INV_COUNT = MERGE-COUNT(A, p, q, r)
6     return INV_COUNT

MERGE-COUNT(A, p, q, r)
1 n1 = q - p + 1
2 n2 = r - q
3 Create arrays L[1..n1+1] and R[1..n2+1]
4 for i = 1 to n1
5     L[i] = A[p + i - 1]
6 for j = 1 to n2
7     R[j] = A[q + j]
8 L[n1 + 1] = ∞
9 R[n2 + 1] = ∞
10 i = 1
11 j = 1
12 INV_COUNT = 0
13 for k = p to r
14     if L[i] <= R[j]
15         A[k] = L[i]
16         i = i + 1
17     else
18         A[k] = R[j]
19         INV_COUNT = INV_COUNT + (n1 - i + 1)
20         j = j + 1
21 return INV_COUNT
```

**Running Time:**
- The algorithm uses merge sort, which runs in $( Θ(n \log n) )$, and counts inversions during the merge step. Thus, the overall time complexity is $( Θ(n \log n) )$.

### 3.1 O-notation, Ω-notation, and Θ-notation

#### 3.1-1: Insertion Sort Lower Bound

**Modification:**
- Handle input sizes not a multiple of 3 by adjusting the argument to consider any partitioning. The lower bound still applies since you can partition the input into roughly equal parts and apply similar reasoning.

#### 3.1-2: Running Time of Selection Sort

- Similar to insertion sort, selection sort has a worst-case running time of $( Θ(n^2) )$, as it involves finding the minimum element in each pass.

#### 3.1-3: Generalizing Lower Bound for Insertion Sort

**Generalization:**
- For an input where the largest $( \alpha n )$ values are in the first $( \alpha n )$ positions, the lower bound argument remains valid but with an additional restriction that $( \alpha )$ should be such that the largest values must traverse the middle $( (1 - 2 \alpha)n )$ positions.

**Maximizing $( \alpha )$:**
- The value of $( \alpha )$ that maximizes this number is typically around 0.5.

### 3.2 Asymptotic Notation: Formal Definitions

#### 3.2-1: Max Function

**Proof:**
- Given $( f(n) = Θ(f(n) + g(n)) )$ where $( f(n) )$ and $( g(n) )$ are asymptotically nonnegative:
  $\text{max}(f(n), g(n)) = Θ(f

(n) + g(n))$
- This is because $( \text{max}(f(n), g(n)) )$ will be bounded by $( f(n) + g(n) )$.

#### 3.2-2: Meaning of Statement

- The statement "<The running time of algorithm A is at least $( O(n^2) )$>" is meaningless because $( O(n^2) )$ denotes an upper bound, not a lower bound.

#### 3.2-3: Asymptotic Comparisons

- $( 2^n + 1 = O(2^n) )$
- $( 2^{2n} \neq O(2^n) )$; $( 2^{2n} = O(2^{2n}) )$

#### 3.2-4: Proving Theorem 3.1

- The proof involves showing that $( f(n) = Θ(g(n)) )$ if and only if $( f(n) )$ is both $( O(g(n)) )$ and $( Ω(g(n)) )$.

#### 3.2-5: Running Time and Θ-Notation

- Prove that $( f(n) )$ is $( Θ(g(n)) )$ if and only if:
  - $( f(n) )$ is $( O(g(n)) )$
  - $( f(n) )$ is $( Ω(g(n)) )$

#### 3.2-6: $( o(g(n)) \cap Ω(g(n)) )$

- This set is empty because $( o(g(n)) )$ represents functions that grow slower than $( g(n) )$, while $( Ω(g(n)) )$ represents functions that grow at least as fast as $( g(n) )$.

#### 3.2-7: Golden Ratio

- The golden ratio $( \phi )$ and its conjugate $( \overline{\phi} )$ satisfy:
  $x^2 = x + 1$

#### 3.2-8: Fibonacci Numbers

- Proof by induction involves showing that:
  $F_i = \frac{\phi^i - \overline{\phi}^i}{\sqrt{5}}$

#### 3.2-9: Asymptotic Bound

- If $( k \log k = Θ(n) )$, then $( k = Θ(n / \log n) )$.

### 3-1 Asymptotic Behavior of Polynomials

#### a. If $( k < d )$

- $( p(n) = Θ(n^d) )$, so $( p(n) = O(n^k) )$.

#### b. If $( k = d )$

- $( p(n) = Θ(n^d) )$, so $( p(n) = Θ(n^k) )$.

#### c. If $( k > d )$

- $( p(n) = o(n^k) )$, as $( n^d )$ grows slower than $( n^k )$.

#### d. If $( k < d )$

- $( p(n) = Ω(n^d) )$, which is asymptotically larger than $( n^k )$.

### 3-2 Relative Asymptotic Growths

#### a. lg^k n vs $( n^\epsilon )$

- $( \text{lg}^k n = o(n^\epsilon) )$ for any $( \epsilon > 0 )$.

#### b. $( n^k )$ vs $( c^n )$

- $( n^k = o(c^n) )$ for any constant $( c > 1 )$.

#### c. $( p(n) )$ vs $( n^{\sin n} )$

- If $( p(n) )$ is a polynomial, $( p(n) = o(n^{\sin n}) )$, since $( \sin n )$ is bounded and oscillates.

#### d. $( 2^n )$ vs $( 2^{n/2} )$

- $( 2^n = Ω(2^{n/2}) )$.

#### e. $( n^{\log c} )$ vs $( c \log n )$

- $( n^{\log c} = Θ(n^{\log c}) )$ and is asymptotically larger than $( c \log n )$.

#### f. $( \text{lg}^n n )$ vs $( \text{lg}(\text{lg} n) )$

- $( \text{lg}^n n )$ grows faster than $( \text{lg}(\text{lg} n) )$.

### 3-3 Ordering by Asymptotic Growth Rates

**Ranking Functions by Growth Rate:**

a. $( \text{lg}^k n )$ vs $( n^{\epsilon} )$

- $( n^{\epsilon} )$ grows faster.

b. $( n^k )$ vs $( c^n )$

- $( c^n )$ grows faster.

c. $( p(n) )$ vs $( n^{\sin n} )$

- $( n^{\sin n} )$ grows faster for large $( n )$.

d. $( 2^n )$ vs $( 2^{n/2} )$

- $( 2^n )$ grows faster.

e. $( n^{\log c} )$ vs $( c \log n )$

- $( n^{\log c} )$ grows faster.

f. $( \text{lg}^n n )$ vs $( \text{lg}(\text{lg} n) )$

- $( \text{lg}^n n )$ grows faster.

Let's work through these exercises from Chapter 3 and Chapter 4 of your textbook.

### 3-3: Ordering by Asymptotic Growth Rates

#### a. $( \text{lg}^k n )$ vs $( n^\epsilon )$

- **Growth Comparison**: For any constant $( \epsilon > 0 )$, $( n^\epsilon )$ grows faster than $( \text{lg}^k n )$ because $( n^\epsilon )$ is polynomial while $( \text{lg}^k n )$ is a logarithmic power.

#### b. $( n^k )$ vs $( c^n )$

- **Growth Comparison**: $( c^n )$ grows faster than $( n^k )$ for any constant $( c > 1 )$ because exponential functions grow faster than polynomial functions.

#### c. $( p(n) )$ vs $( n^{\sin n} )$

- **Growth Comparison**: If $( p(n) )$ is a polynomial, then $( p(n) = o(n^{\sin n}) )$. This is because $( \sin n )$ oscillates between $(-1)$ and $(1)$, so $( n^{\sin n} )$ oscillates between $( n^{-1} )$ and $( n )$. For large $( n )$, $( n^{\sin n} )$ can grow significantly faster than any polynomial $( p(n) )$.

#### d. $( 2^n )$ vs $( 2^{n/2} )$

- **Growth Comparison**: $( 2^n )$ grows faster than $( 2^{n/2} )$ because $( 2^n )$ is an exponential function with a larger exponent.

#### e. $( n^{\log c} )$ vs $( c \log n )$

- **Growth Comparison**: $( n^{\log c} )$ grows faster than $( c \log n )$. $( n^{\log c} )$ is a polynomial function while $( c \log n )$ is logarithmic.

#### f. $( \text{lg}^n n )$ vs $( \text{lg}(\text{lg} n) )$

- **Growth Comparison**: $( \text{lg}^n n )$ grows faster than $( \text{lg}(\text{lg} n) )$ because iterated logarithms grow slower than repeated logarithms.

### 3-4: Asymptotic Notation Properties

#### a. $( f(n) = O(g(n)) )$ implies $( g(n) = O(f(n)) )$

- **Disproof**: This statement is not true in general. For example, if $( f(n) = n )$ and $( g(n) = n^2 )$, then $( f(n) = O(g(n)) )$ but $( g(n) )$ is not $( O(f(n)) )$.

#### b. $( f(n) + g(n) = Θ(\text{min}(f(n), g(n))) )$

- **Disproof**: This is not true in general. For example, if $( f(n) = n )$ and $( g(n) = n^2 )$, then $( f(n) + g(n) = Θ(n^2) )$ which is not equal to $( Θ(\text{min}(n, n^2)) = Θ(n) )$.

#### c. $( f(n) = O(g(n)) )$ implies $( \text{lg} f(n) = O(\text{lg} g(n)) )$

- **Proof**: This is true. If $( f(n) \leq c g(n) )$ for sufficiently large $( n )$, then $( \text{lg} f(n) \leq \text{lg} (c g(n)) = \text{lg} c + \text{lg} g(n) )$, which implies $( \text{lg} f(n) = O(\text{lg} g(n)) )$.

#### d. $( f(n) = O(g(n)) )$ implies $( 2f(n) = O(2g(n)) )$

- **Proof**: This is true. If $( f(n) \leq c g(n) )$ for sufficiently large $( n )$, then $( 2f(n) \leq 2c g(n) )$, which implies $( 2f(n) = O(g(n)) )$ not $( O(2g(n)) )$ (note that $( 2g(n) )$ is essentially $( O(g(n)) )$).

#### e. $( f(n) = O((f(n))^2) )$

- **Disproof**: This is not true in general. For example, if $( f(n) = \sqrt{n} )$, then $( (f(n))^2 = n )$, and $( f(n) = O((f(n))^2) )$ does not hold since $( \sqrt{n} )$ is not $( O(n) )$.

#### f. $( f(n) = O(g(n)) )$ implies $( g(n) = Θ(f(n)) )$

- **Disproof**: This is not necessarily true. For example, if $( f(n) = n )$ and $( g(n) = n^2 )$, then $( f(n) = O(g(n)) )$, but $( g(n) )$ is not $( Θ(f(n)) )$.

#### g. $( f(n) = Θ(f(n/2)) )$

- **Disproof**: This is not true in general. For example, if $( f(n) = n )$, then $( f(n/2) = n/2 )$ and $( f(n) = Θ(n) \neq Θ(n/2) )$.

#### h. $( f(n) + o(f(n)) = Θ(f(n)) )$

- **Proof**: This is true. If $( f(n) )$ is the dominating term and $( o(f(n)) )$ is a lower-order term, their sum is dominated by $( f(n) )$, so $( f(n) + o(f(n)) = Θ(f(n)) )$.

### 3-5: Manipulating Asymptotic Notation

#### a. $( Θ(Θ(f(n))) = Θ(f(n)) )$

- **Proof**: This is true. If $( f(n) = Θ(g(n)) )$, then $( Θ(f(n)) = Θ(g(n)) )$, so $( Θ(Θ(f(n))) = Θ(f(n)) )$.

#### b. $( Θ(f(n)) + O(f(n)) = Θ(f(n)) )$

- **Proof**: This is true. The $( Θ(f(n)) )$ term dominates, so adding $( O(f(n)) )$ does not change the asymptotic class.

#### c. $( Θ(f(n)) + Θ(g(n)) = Θ(f(n) + g(n)) )$

- **Proof**: This is true. The sum of functions in $( Θ )$-notation is equal to $( Θ )$ of their sum.

#### d. $( Θ(f(n)) \cap Θ(g(n)) = Θ(f(n) \cap g(n)) )$

- **Proof**: This is true. The intersection of two sets of asymptotic functions is the set of functions that are in both, which corresponds to $( Θ )$ of the intersection.

#### e. $( (a_1 n)^{k_1} (\text{lg}^{k_2} (a_2 n)) = Θ(n^{k_1} \text{lg}^{k_2} n) )$

- **Proof**: This is true. By expanding the powers, we get the same asymptotic expression.

#### f. $( \sum_{k \in S} Θ(f(k)) = Θ(\sum_{k \in S} f(k)) )$

- **Proof**: This is true, assuming the sum converges. The sum of functions in $( Θ )$-notation equals $( Θ )$ of the sum of their functions.

#### g. $( \prod_{k \in S} Θ(f(k)) = Θ(\prod_{k \in S} f(k)) )$

- **Disproof**: This is not necessarily true. For example, if $( f(k) = k )$ and $( S = \{1, 2\} )$, then $( \prod_{k \in S} Θ(f(k)) = Θ(1 \cdot 2) \neq Θ(\prod_{k \in S} k) )$.

### 3-6: Variations on O and Θ

#### a. For any two asymptotically nonnegative functions $( f(n) )$ and $( g(n) )$, either $( f(n) = O(g(n)) )$ or $( f(n) = \Omega(g(n)) )$

- **Proof**: This is true. Every function is either dominated by or dominates another in asymptotic terms.

#### b. There exist functions $( f(n) )$ and $( g(n) )$ where neither $( f(n) = O(g(n)) )$ nor $( f(n) = \Omega(g(n)) )$

- **Proof**: This is true. For example, $( f(n) = n )$ and $( g(n) = 2^n )$ are neither $( O(2^n) )$ nor $( \Omega(n) )$ (they do not fit into either asymptotic class).

#### c. **Advantages and Disadvantages of Using $( \omega )$-notation**

- **Advantages**: More nuanced comparison, especially for functions where $( O \

) notation may be too broad.
- **Disadvantages**: Less common and may be less intuitive.

#### d. **Best Uses of $( \Theta )$-notation**

- **Best Uses**: For precise asymptotic behavior where both upper and lower bounds are of interest.

### Probabilistic Analysis and Randomized Algorithms

#### 5.4: Probabilistic Analysis and Further Uses of Indicator Random Variables

This section explores probabilistic analysis using indicator random variables, focusing on the length of the longest streak of heads in coin flips and the online hiring problem. Let's break down the key points:

#### 1. Expected Length of the Longest Streak of Heads

**Problem Setup**:
- You have $( n )$ coin flips and want to analyze the longest streak of heads.

**Upper Bound**:
- The probability of encountering a streak of at least $( 2 \lg n )$ heads is at most $( \frac{1}{n} )$.
- For a streak of $( 3 \lg n )$ heads, the probability is $( \frac{1}{n^2} )$.

**Lower Bound**:
- To find the expected length of the longest streak, partition the $( n )$ coin flips into groups.
- Each group has a length of $( \frac{\lg n}{2} )$.
- The probability of no group having a streak of length $( \frac{\lg n}{2} )$ is approximately $( e^{-\frac{2n}{\lg n} \cdot \frac{1}{p}} )$, which is $( O\left(\frac{1}{n}\right) )$.
- Therefore, the probability that there is at least one group with a streak of $( \frac{\lg n}{2} )$ heads is $( 1 - O\left(\frac{1}{n}\right) )$.
- This implies the expected length of the longest streak is $( \Omega(\lg n) )$.

**Expected Number of Streaks**:
- Let $( X_{k} )$ be the number of streaks of length at least $( k )$.
- $( E[X_{k}] = \frac{n - k + 1}{2^{k}} )$.
- For $( k = c \lg n )$:
  - $( E[X_{c \lg n}] = \frac{n - c \lg n + 1}{2^{c \lg n}} = \frac{n}{n^{c}} \cdot (1 - \frac{c \lg n}{n}) \approx \frac{1}{n^{c-1}} )$.

#### 2. Online Hiring Problem

**Problem Setup**:
- You must hire one candidate after interviewing them and are not allowed to rehire.
- After each interview, you can either hire immediately or reject the candidate.

**Strategy**:
- Interview and reject the first $( k )$ candidates.
- Hire the first candidate thereafter who has a score higher than all the previously interviewed candidates.

**Trade-off**:
- You need to balance between the number of interviews and the quality of the hired candidate.
- The optimal $( k )$ is found to be around $( n/e )$, leading to a probability of hiring a candidate close to the best with a balance between the number of interviews and the likelihood of hiring a top candidate.

### Key Insights:

1. **Streak Analysis**: The longest streak of heads grows logarithmically with $( n )$. By partitioning and analyzing probabilities, you can establish bounds on the expected length of these streaks.

2. **Hiring Problem**: Using a strategy of rejecting a fixed number of candidates and then hiring the next better one provides a balance between hiring quality and the number of interviews.

### Online Hiring Problem

In this section, you have a variant of the hiring problem where you want to hire a candidate who is close to the best candidate, without re-interviewing and without firing anyone. You can only make one hiring decision, and you must decide to hire or reject each candidate immediately. 

#### ONLINE-MAXIMUM Algorithm

**Algorithm**:
```plaintext
ONLINE-MAXIMUM(k, n)
1 best-score = -1
2 for i = 1 to k
3     if score[i] > best-score
4         best-score = score[i]
5 for i = k + 1 to n
6     if score[i] > best-score
7         return i
8 return n
```

**Explanation**:
- **Initial Phase**: The algorithm rejects the first $( k )$ candidates, recording the highest score among them.
- **Selection Phase**: From the $( k+1 )$th candidate onward, it hires the first candidate with a score greater than the highest score among the first $( k )$ candidates.
- **Fallback**: If no such candidate is found, the algorithm defaults to hiring the last candidate.

**Probability Analysis**:

1. **Events and Probabilities**:
   - Let $( M(j) )$ be the maximum score among the first $( j )$ applicants.
   - Let $( S )$ be the event of hiring the best-qualified applicant.
   - Let $( S_i )$ be the event of hiring the best-qualified applicant when the best applicant is in position $( i )$.

   We have:
   $ \Pr[S] = \sum_{i=k+1}^{n} \Pr[S_i]$

   **For $( i )$ from $( k+1 )$ to $( n )$**:
   - To succeed when the best applicant is at position $( i )$:
     1. The best applicant must be in position $( i )$ ($( B_i )$).
     2. None of the applicants from position $( k+1 )$ to $( i-1 )$ should have a score greater than the maximum score among the first $( k )$ applicants ($( O_i )$).

   - **Independence**: The events $( B_i )$ and $( O_i )$ are independent.

   $ \Pr[S_i] = \Pr[B_i] \cdot \Pr[O_i]$

   - $( \Pr[B_i] = \frac{1}{n} )$ (the best applicant is equally likely to be in any position).
   - $( \Pr[O_i] = \frac{k}{i-1} )$ (the maximum of the first $( i-1 )$ candidates must be among the first $( k )$).

   Thus:
   $ \Pr[S_i] = \frac{k}{n(i-1)}$

   **Summing Up**:
   $ \Pr[S] = \sum_{i=k+1}^{n} \frac{k}{n(i-1)} = \frac{k}{n} \sum_{i=k}^{n-1} \frac{1}{i}$

   **Bounds**:
   Using integrals to approximate the summation:
   $ \int_{k}^{n-1} \frac{1}{x} \, dx = \ln(n-1) - \ln(k) \approx \ln\left(\frac{n}{k}\right)$

   Thus:
   $\Pr[S] \approx \frac{k}{n} \ln\left(\frac{n}{k}\right)$

   **Optimization**:
   - To maximize the probability of success, differentiate:
     $\frac{k}{n} (\ln n - \ln k)$
     Set the derivative to zero:
     $\frac{1}{n} (\ln n - \ln k - 1) = 0 \implies \ln k = \ln n - 1 \implies k = \frac{n}{e}$

   - Thus, the optimal $( k )$ is approximately $( \frac{n}{e} )$, and the probability of hiring the best applicant is at least $( \frac{1}{e} )$.

### Exercises and Problems

#### 5.4-1
To find the number of people needed before the probability that someone has the same birthday as you is at least 1/2, use the birthday paradox formula. The approximate answer is 23 people. For at least two people having a birthday on July 4, use the binomial approximation with a similar approach.

#### 5.4-2
To have a 99% probability of at least two people sharing a birthday, you need approximately 57 people. The expected number of pairs with the same birthday can be calculated using combinatorics.

#### 5.4-3
For the birthday problem where balls are tossed into bins, the expected number of tosses until a bin contains two balls is approximately $( \sqrt{\pi b / 2} )$, where $( b )$ is the number of bins.

#### 5.4-4
Mutual independence of birthdays is important in the birthday paradox to accurately calculate the probability. Pairwise independence is not sufficient.

#### 5.4-5
To make it likely that there are three people with the same birthday, you need approximately 88 people.

#### 5.4-6
The probability that a k-string forms a k-permutation is related to the birthday paradox by considering permutations rather than just combinations.

#### 5.4-7
The expected number of empty bins and bins with exactly one ball after tossing $( n )$ balls into $( n )$ bins can be found using the linearity of expectation.

#### 5.4-8
To sharpen the lower bound on streak length, you can use the technique to show that in $( n )$ flips, the probability of a streak of length $( \lg n - 2 \lg \lg n )$ is at least $( 1 - \frac{1}{n} )$.

### Probabilistic Counting

**Problem 5-1**

**a. Expected Value of the Counter**

Given a counter where $( n_i )$ is a sequence such as $( n_i = i )$, $( n_i = 2i - 1 )$, or $( n_i = F_i )$ (the $(i)$th Fibonacci number), we need to show that the expected value represented by the counter after $( n )$ `INCREMENT` operations is exactly $( n )$.

**Solution:**

Let $( C )$ be the counter's value after $( n )$ increments. We can use the probabilistic counting approach, where each increment is performed with a certain probability.

1. **Expected Value Calculation:**

   Each increment operation increases the counter value by 1 with probability $( \frac{1}{n_i - n_{i-1}} )$. We need to compute the expected value of $( C )$, the sum of these increments.

   For a counter with $( n_i )$ increasing by a specific function, let’s use $( n_i = i )$ as a simple case:

   - Each increment operation succeeds with probability $( \frac{1}{i} )$for the $(i)$th increment operation.
   - Over $( n )$ operations, the expected number of successful increments is:

     $\text{Expected value} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{1}{i} \cdot 1 = n$

   Thus, after $( n )$ increments, the expected value of the counter is exactly $( n )$, regardless of the function $( n_i )$ as long as the function grows appropriately.

**b. Variance with $( n_i = 100i )$**

Given $( n_i = 100i )$, we need to estimate the variance in the counter value after $( n )$ increments.

**Solution:**

1. **Variance Calculation:**

   The probability of success for the $(i)$th increment operation is $( \frac{1}{100i - 100(i-1)} = \frac{1}{100} )$.

   For each operation, the increment operation is successful with a constant probability of $( \frac{1}{100} )$. The number of successful increments follows a binomial distribution with parameters $( n )$ and $( p = \frac{1}{100} )$.

   - Variance of a binomial random variable $( X )$ with parameters $( n )$ and $( p )$ is:

     $\text{Var}(X) = np(1 - p)$

   - Here $( p = \frac{1}{100} )$, so:

     $\text{Var}(X) = n \cdot \frac{1}{100} \cdot \left(1 - \frac{1}{100}\right) \approx \frac{n}{100}$

   Thus, the variance of the counter value after $( n )$ increments is approximately $( \frac{n}{100} )$.

### Searching an Unsorted Array

**Problem 5-2**

**a. RANDOM-SEARCH Algorithm**

**Pseudocode:**

```plaintext
RANDOM-SEARCH(A, x)
1 n = length(A)
2 S = set of indices in A
3 while S is not empty
4     i = random index from S
5     if A[i] == x
6         return i
7     S = S \ {i}  // Remove index i from S
8 return "x not found"
```

**b. Expected Number of Indices**

If there is exactly one index $( i )$ where $( A[i] = x )$:

- The probability of picking the correct index on each draw is $( \frac{1}{n} )$.
- The expected number of draws to find $( x )$ is:

  $\frac{n}{1} = n$

**c. Expected Number of Indices with $( k )$ Indices for $( x )$**

If there are $( k )$ indices where $( A[i] = x )$:

- Each index is picked with probability $( \frac{k}{n} )$.
- The expected number of draws until one of these $( k )$ indices is picked follows a geometric distribution:

  $\text{Expected number of draws} = \frac{n}{k}$

**d. Expected Number of Indices with No $( x )$**

If there are no indices where $( A[i] = x )$:

- All indices must be picked to check all elements.
- The expected number of indices picked to check all $( n )$ elements is:

  $\text{Expected number of draws} = n \text{ (since you will eventually check all indices)}$

**e. DETERMINISTIC-SEARCH Average and Worst-Case Running Time**

**Average-Case Running Time:**

If there is exactly one $( i )$ such that $( A[i] = x )$:

- The expected position of $( x )$ in a randomly shuffled array is:

  $\frac{n + 1}{2}$

  Hence, the average-case running time is $( \frac{n + 1}{2} )$.

**Worst-Case Running Time:**

- The worst-case running time is $( n )$ (if $( x )$ is at the end or not present).

**f. Generalizing for $( k )$ Indices**

**Average-Case Running Time:**

- If there are $( k )$ indices where $( A[i] = x )$, the average position of finding $( x )$ is $( \frac{n + 1}{k + 1} )$.

**Worst-Case Running Time:**

- Worst-case running time remains $( n )$ (if $( x )$ is at the end or not present).

**g. No $( x )$ in Array**

**Average-Case Running Time:**

- If no $( x )$ is in the array, you will check all $( n )$ elements. Average-case time is $( n )$.

**Worst-Case Running Time:**

- The worst-case time is also $( n )$ (you will always check all elements).

**h. SCRAMBLE-SEARCH Running Times**

**Worst-Case and Expected Running Times:**

- **If $( k = 0 )$**: Worst-case and expected running time is $( n )$ because the array must be fully searched.
  
- **If $( k = 1 )$**: The worst-case time is $( n )$ (if $( x )$ is at the end), and the expected running time is $( \frac{n + 1}{2} )$.

- **General Case with $( k \ge 1 )$**:
  - **Expected Running Time**: Similar to the average case of the deterministic search when the array is permuted randomly.
  - **Worst-Case Running Time**: $( n )$ (if $( x )$ is at the end or no $( x )$ in the array).

**i. Algorithm Selection**

**Choosing the Best Algorithm:**

- **RANDOM-SEARCH**: Simple but can be inefficient as it may check the same index multiple times.
  
- **DETERMINISTIC-SEARCH**: Guaranteed to find $( x )$ in $( n )$ checks (worst-case) and efficient on average.

- **SCRAMBLE-SEARCH**: Combines the advantage of randomness in the search with deterministic searching but does not improve worst-case performance.

**Recommendation**:
- Use **DETERMINISTIC-SEARCH** for a guaranteed result in linear time.
- Use **RANDOM-SEARCH** if simplicity and flexibility are preferred and worst-case performance is acceptable.
- **SCRAMBLE-SEARCH** may be useful if you want to randomize the input and use linear search thereafter, but does not fundamentally improve performance.

Each algorithm has its context of suitability depending on the specific needs for efficiency, simplicity, and worst-case guarantees.
