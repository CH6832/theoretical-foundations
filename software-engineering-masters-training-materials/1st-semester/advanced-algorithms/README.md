# Advanced Algorithms

## Course Overview

This course focuses on advanced algorithmic techniques, including sophisticated data structures, dynamic programming, and graph algorithms. It emphasizes the development of efficient algorithms and their analysis.

## Course Content

1. **Advanced Data Structures**
   - Self-balancing trees (AVL, Red-Black)
   - Hashing techniques
   - Fenwick trees, segment trees, and binary indexed trees
   - Union-Find structures

2. **Dynamic Programming**
   - Tabulation and memoization
   - Optimal substructure and overlapping subproblems
   - Advanced problems (Knapsack, Edit Distance, Longest Common Subsequence)

3. **Graph Algorithms**
   - Shortest paths (Dijkstra’s, Bellman-Ford)
   - Maximum flow (Ford-Fulkerson, Edmonds-Karp)
   - Minimum spanning trees (Prim’s, Kruskal’s)
   - Network flows and bipartite matching

4. **NP-Hard and Approximation Algorithms**
   - P vs NP, NP-completeness
   - Approximation techniques (greedy algorithms, LP rounding)
   - Case studies (TSP, Set Cover)

5. **Randomized Algorithms**
   - Monte Carlo and Las Vegas algorithms
   - Hashing and probabilistic data structures (Bloom filters)
