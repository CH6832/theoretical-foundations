# Software Architecture and Design Patterns

## Course Overview
This course introduces key concepts in software architecture and design patterns, focusing on building scalable and maintainable software systems. It covers architectural styles, SOLID principles, and various design patterns.

## Course Content
1. **Introduction to Software Architecture**
   - Architectural styles (Monolithic, Microservices, SOA)
   - Layered architecture
   - Architectural trade-offs (performance, maintainability)

2. **SOLID Principles**
   - Single Responsibility Principle
   - Open/Closed Principle
   - Liskov Substitution Principle
   - Interface Segregation Principle
   - Dependency Inversion Principle

3. **Creational Patterns**
   - Singleton, Factory, Builder, Prototype
   - Dependency Injection

4. **Structural Patterns**
   - Adapter, Decorator, Proxy, Facade, Composite

5. **Behavioral Patterns**
   - Strategy, Observer, Command, Chain of Responsibility

6. **Distributed Systems Design Patterns**
   - Event-driven architecture
   - Saga patterns
   - Circuit breakers, retries, fallbacks
   - Scalability and fault-tolerance
