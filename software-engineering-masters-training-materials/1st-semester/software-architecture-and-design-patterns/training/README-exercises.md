# Software Architecture and Design Patterns Exercises

### Understand Architectural Styles
- Describe the key differences between monolithic and microservices architectures. In what scenarios would you choose one over the other?
- Design a simple application using layered architecture. Define the responsibilities of each layer.
- Create a diagram that illustrates the relationships between services in a microservices architecture. Include details on how they communicate.

### SOLID Principles
- Rewrite a given class to adhere to the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) by splitting it into multiple classes. Justify your design choices.
- Analyze an existing codebase and identify violations of the Open/Closed Principle (OCP). Propose modifications to make the code compliant with OCP.
- Implement a subclass that violates the Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP). Discuss how the violation could impact the system.
- Refactor an interface that violates the Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) into smaller, more specific interfaces. Explain the benefits of this approach.
- Design a simple application that follows the Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP). Illustrate how high-level modules depend on abstractions instead of concrete implementations.

### Creational Patterns
- Implement a Singleton class in a multi-threaded environment. Discuss potential issues and how to resolve them.
- Create a factory method for a product line that includes at least three different product types. Provide a demonstration of the factory in action.
- Design a builder for constructing a complex object (e.g., a vehicle with multiple attributes). Demonstrate the builder pattern with an example.
- Implement a prototype pattern that enables cloning of an object with mutable state. Discuss challenges you might face with deep vs. shallow copying.

### Structural Patterns
- Create an adapter that allows a new payment method to integrate into an existing e-commerce application. Provide a sample usage.
- Develop a composite pattern to represent a file system structure, including files and directories. Demonstrate operations on this structure.
- Design a coffee shop application that uses the decorator pattern to add different features (e.g., milk, sugar) to a coffee order. Provide examples of use.

### Behavioral Patterns
- Implement a strategy pattern that allows users to choose different sorting algorithms. Compare the performance of different strategies.
- Create a simple observer pattern implementation where a news agency notifies subscribers of news updates. Provide an example of subscriber behavior.
- Design a command pattern for a remote control application. Implement commands to turn on and off various devices. Show how to queue commands for execution.

### General Software Design
- Analyze a real-world application (e.g., a mobile app) and describe its architectural style. What are the strengths and weaknesses of this architecture?
- Write a report on the importance of design patterns in software development. Include examples from various projects you've encountered.
- Propose an architecture for a new social media platform. Outline the key components, their responsibilities, and how they interact.

### Advanced Topics
- Discuss how you would integrate a caching mechanism into a microservices architecture to improve performance. What challenges might you face?
- Design an API for a web service using REST principles. Consider how to handle different HTTP methods and response types.
- Evaluate the trade-offs between synchronous and asynchronous communication in microservices. Provide examples of when to use each.

### Real-World Application
- Pick a design pattern and identify a real-world application that uses it. Describe how the pattern is implemented and its benefits.
- Create a small project where you implement several design patterns. Document the patterns used and the rationale for choosing each.
- Investigate a legacy system and propose a refactor using modern architectural principles. Discuss potential challenges in implementation.

### Reflection and Discussion
- Reflect on a software project you worked on. Identify any design patterns you used and discuss their impact on the project's success.
- Engage with peers in a discussion about the challenges of applying design patterns in real-world projects. Share experiences and solutions.
- Consider the impact of software architecture on team collaboration. Discuss how architectural decisions can influence team dynamics and communication.

### Code Review and Improvement
- Review a codebase and identify areas where design patterns could be applied to improve maintainability. Propose specific patterns and modifications.
- Create a checklist of best practices for applying SOLID principles in software design. Use this checklist to review your own work.
- Pair program with a colleague to refactor a piece of legacy code. Apply design patterns as necessary, and discuss the changes made.

### Continuous Learning
- Research a design pattern not covered in this document. Present your findings to the team, including its use cases and implementation examples.
- Follow an online course on software architecture or design patterns. Document key learnings and how you plan to apply them in future projects.
- Join a community of software developers focused on architecture and design patterns. Participate in discussions and share insights from your projects.
