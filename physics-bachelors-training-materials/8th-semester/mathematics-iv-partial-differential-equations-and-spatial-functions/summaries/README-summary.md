## Key Topics

### Partial Differential Equations (PDEs)

#### Basic PDEs

**Classification of PDEs:**

PDEs are classified based on the nature of their solutions and the properties of the equations. The classification helps determine the appropriate methods for solving them.

1. **Elliptic PDEs:**
   - **Definition:**
     Elliptic PDEs typically describe steady-state phenomena where time does not explicitly appear. These equations involve second-order partial derivatives. They are characterized by having no time dependence.

     **General Form:**
     \[
     A \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} + B \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y^2} + C \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial z^2} + \text{(lower order terms)} = 0
     \]

   - **Example:**
     The Laplace equation is a classic example of an elliptic PDE:
     \[
     \nabla^2 u = 0
     \]
     where \( \nabla^2 \) is the Laplacian operator, defined as:
     \[
     \nabla^2 u = \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y^2} + \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial z^2}
     \]
     This equation models steady-state temperature distributions or electrostatic potentials.

2. **Parabolic PDEs:**
   - **Definition:**
     Parabolic PDEs describe time-dependent processes that evolve towards a steady state, such as heat conduction. They involve time and spatial derivatives.

     **General Form:**
     \[
     \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = A \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} + \text{(lower order terms)}
     \]

   - **Example:**
     The heat equation is a fundamental parabolic PDE:
     \[
     \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = \alpha \nabla^2 u
     \]
     where \( \alpha \) is the thermal diffusivity. This equation describes how heat diffuses through a medium over time.

3. **Hyperbolic PDEs:**
   - **Definition:**
     Hyperbolic PDEs model wave propagation and oscillatory phenomena. They involve second-order time derivatives and describe systems with wave-like solutions.

     **General Form:**
     \[
     \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial t^2} = c^2 \left( \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} \right) + \text{(lower order terms)}
     \]

   - **Example:**
     The wave equation is a standard hyperbolic PDE:
     \[
     \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial t^2} = c^2 \nabla^2 u
     \]
     where \( c \) is the wave speed. This equation models the propagation of waves through a medium, such as sound waves or electromagnetic waves.

**Canonical Forms:**

To simplify solving PDEs, they are often transformed into canonical forms where their characteristics are more apparent.

1. **Elliptic Canonical Form:**
   Transforming to:

   \[
   \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y^2} = 0
   \]

   This form helps in solving problems in two dimensions, such as steady-state heat conduction or electrostatic potential.

2. **Parabolic Canonical Form:**
   Transforming to:

   \[
   \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = \alpha \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}
   \]

   This form is used to solve heat conduction problems with specified initial and boundary conditions.

3. **Hyperbolic Canonical Form:**
   Transforming to:

   \[
   \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial t^2} = c^2 \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}
   \]

   This form is used for problems involving wave propagation, such as vibrations or sound waves.

#### Solution Techniques

**Separation of Variables:**

A method used to solve PDEs by reducing them to simpler ordinary differential equations (ODEs).

1. **Method:**
   Assume a solution of the form \( u(x, t) = X(x) T(t) \). Substitute this into the PDE:

   For the heat equation:

   \[
   \frac{\partial (X(x) T(t))}{\partial t} = \alpha \frac{\partial^2 (X(x) T(t))}{\partial x^2}
   \]

   This simplifies to:

   \[
   X(x) \frac{dT(t)}{dt} = \alpha T(t) \frac{d^2 X(x)}{dx^2}
   \]

   Divide both sides by \( X(x) T(t) \):

   \[
   \frac{1}{T(t)} \frac{dT(t)}{dt} = \frac{\alpha}{X(x)} \frac{d^2 X(x)}{dx^2} = -\lambda
   \]

   where \( \lambda \) is a separation constant.

2. **Example:**
   For the heat equation, the ODEs are:

   - **Time ODE:**

     \[
     \frac{dT(t)}{dt} = -\lambda \alpha T(t)
     \]

     Solution: \( T(t) = T_0 e^{-\lambda \alpha t} \)

   - **Spatial ODE:**

     \[
     \frac{d^2 X(x)}{dx^2} = -\lambda X(x)
     \]

     Solution: \( X(x) = A \sin(\sqrt{\lambda} x) + B \cos(\sqrt{\lambda} x) \)

   Combining the solutions gives the general solution for \( u(x, t) \).

**Method of Characteristics:**

A technique used to solve first-order PDEs by converting them into a set of ODEs along characteristic curves.

1. **Method:**
   Consider a first-order PDE of the form:

   \[
   a(x, y) \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} + b(x, y) \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} = c(x, y, u)
   \]

   The characteristic curves are found by solving:

   \[
   \frac{dx}{a(x, y)} = \frac{dy}{b(x, y)} = \frac{du}{c(x, y, u)}
   \]

   These curves help transform the PDE into simpler ODEs.

2. **Example:**
   For the PDE:

   \[
   \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} + u \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = 0
   \]

   The characteristics are:

   \[
   \frac{dx}{1} = \frac{dt}{0} = \frac{du}{-u}
   \]

   Solving these gives the solution \( u(x, t) = u_0(x - t) \), where \( u_0 \) is the initial condition.

**Boundary and Initial Conditions:**

Boundary and initial conditions are essential for solving PDEs, providing specific values or behaviors at the boundaries and initial times.

1. **Dirichlet Condition:**

   Specifies the value of the function on the boundary:

   \[
   u(x, y) \big|_{\text{boundary}} = g(x, y)
   \]

   For example, in a rectangular domain, if \( u(x, 0) = 0 \) and \( u(x, L) = 0 \), the Dirichlet condition fixes the temperature to zero at the boundaries.

2. **Neumann Condition:**

   Specifies the value of the derivative (flux) on the boundary:

   \[
   \frac{\partial u}{\partial n} \big|_{\text{boundary}} = h(x, y)
   \]

   For example, if the heat flux is constant along the boundary, \( \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = 0 \), it indicates an insulating boundary.

3. **Initial Value Problems:**

   Involve solving PDEs with given initial conditions:

   \[
   u(x, 0) = f(x)
   \]

   For the heat equation, if \( u(x, 0) = \sin(\pi x) \), the initial temperature distribution is a sine wave.

### Spatial Functions and Fourier Analysis

**Fourier Series and Transforms:**

**Fourier Series:**

- **Definition:**

  Fourier series decomposes periodic functions into sums of sines and cosines:

  \[
  f(x) = a_0 + \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \left[ a_n \cos\left(\frac{2\pi n x}{T}\right) + b_n

 \sin\left(\frac{2\pi n x}{T}\right) \right]
  \]

  where \( a_n \) and \( b_n \) are the Fourier coefficients, and \( T \) is the period of the function.

- **Coefficients:**

  - **\( a_0 \) (average value):**

    \[
    a_0 = \frac{1}{T} \int_{0}^{T} f(x) \, dx
    \]

  - **\( a_n \) (cosine coefficients):**

    \[
    a_n = \frac{2}{T} \int_{0}^{T} f(x) \cos\left(\frac{2\pi n x}{T}\right) \, dx
    \]

  - **\( b_n \) (sine coefficients):**

    \[
    b_n = \frac{2}{T} \int_{0}^{T} f(x) \sin\left(\frac{2\pi n x}{T}\right) \, dx
    \]

**Fourier Transforms:**

- **Definition:**

  Fourier transforms convert functions from the time domain to the frequency domain:

  \[
  \hat{f}(k) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x) e^{-ikx} \, dx
  \]

  where \( \hat{f}(k) \) is the Fourier transform of \( f(x) \), and \( k \) is the frequency variable.

- **Inverse Transform:**

  Convert back to the time domain:

  \[
  f(x) = \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \hat{f}(k) e^{ikx} \, dk
  \]

**Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT):**

- **Definition:**

  The DFT is used to analyze discrete data:

  \[
  X[k] = \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x[n] e^{-i \frac{2 \pi k n}{N}}
  \]

  where \( x[n] \) is the discrete-time signal, and \( X[k] \) represents the frequency components.

- **Fast Fourier Transform (FFT):**

  An efficient algorithm to compute the DFT:

  - **Algorithm:**

    The FFT reduces the computational complexity from \( O(N^2) \) to \( O(N \log N) \), making it suitable for large datasets.

### Numerical Methods for PDEs

**Finite Difference Methods:**

**Grid-Based Approximations:**

- **Method:**

  Approximate derivatives using finite differences on a grid:

  - **First Derivative:**

    \[
    \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} \approx \frac{u_{i+1} - u_i}{\Delta x}
    \]

  - **Second Derivative:**

    \[
    \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} \approx \frac{u_{i+1} - 2u_i + u_{i-1}}{(\Delta x)^2}
    \]

- **Stability and Convergence:**

  Analyze methods for stability and convergence:

  - **Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) Condition:**

    For time-dependent problems, ensure:

    \[
    \text{CFL} = \frac{v \Delta t}{\Delta x} \leq 1
    \]

    where \( v \) is the velocity, \( \Delta t \) is the time step, and \( \Delta x \) is the spatial step.

**Finite Element Methods:**

**Weak Formulations:**

- **Method:**

  Convert PDEs into a weak form by multiplying by a test function and integrating:

  For the heat equation:

  \[
  \int \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} v \, dV = \alpha \int \nabla u \cdot \nabla v \, dV
  \]

  where \( v \) is a test function and \( u \) is the approximate solution.

**Mesh Generation and Solution Techniques:**

- **Mesh Generation:**

  Create a mesh by dividing the domain into smaller elements (triangles, quadrilaterals):

  - **Example:**

    For a 2D domain, use a triangulation to discretize the region.

- **Solution:**

  Assemble the global system of equations from element contributions and solve for the unknowns:

  - **Example:**

    For a linear system, solve:

    \[
    \mathbf{K} \mathbf{u} = \mathbf{F}
    \]

    where \( \mathbf{K} \) is the stiffness matrix, \( \mathbf{u} \) is the vector of unknowns, and \( \mathbf{F} \) is the load vector.
