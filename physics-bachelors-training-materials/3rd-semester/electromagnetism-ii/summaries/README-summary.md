## Key Topics

### Electromagnetic Waves and Radiation

#### Wave Propagation

**Plane Waves in Various Media:**

Maxwell's equations describe how electric and magnetic fields propagate through space. For plane waves, the solutions are particularly simple and reveal much about wave behavior in different media.

1. **Maxwell's Equations:**

   Maxwell's equations in free space are:

   \[
   \nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} = 0
   \]
   \[
   \nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = 0
   \]
   \[
   \nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t}
   \]
   \[
   \nabla \times \mathbf{B} = \mu_0 \epsilon_0 \frac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t}
   \]

   These equations govern the behavior of electric (\(\mathbf{E}\)) and magnetic (\(\mathbf{B}\)) fields.

2. **Plane Wave Solutions:**

   In a medium with permittivity \(\epsilon\) and permeability \(\mu\), the plane wave solutions to Maxwell's equations are of the form:

   \[
   \mathbf{E}(x,t) = \mathbf{E}_0 e^{i(\mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{r} - \omega t)}
   \]
   \[
   \mathbf{B}(x,t) = \mathbf{B}_0 e^{i(\mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{r} - \omega t)}
   \]

   where \(\mathbf{k}\) is the wave vector, \(\omega\) is the angular frequency, and \(\mathbf{E}_0\) and \(\mathbf{B}_0\) are the electric and magnetic field amplitudes. The relationship between \(\omega\) and \(\mathbf{k}\) is given by:

   \[
   \omega^2 = c^2 k^2
   \]

   where \(c\) is the speed of light in the medium, \(c = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\mu \epsilon}}\).

**Waveguides and Resonators:**

1. **Waveguides:**

   Waveguides are structures that confine and guide electromagnetic waves. For example, rectangular waveguides have dimensions \(a\) and \(b\), and the propagation of modes is determined by:

   \[
   \beta^2 = k^2 - \left(\frac{m \pi}{a}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{n \pi}{b}\right)^2
   \]

   where \(\beta\) is the propagation constant, \(m\) and \(n\) are mode indices, and \(k\) is the free-space wave number.

2. **Resonators:**

   Resonators are cavities that support standing waves at specific frequencies. For a simple spherical resonator, the resonant frequencies are:

   \[
   \omega_{mn} = \frac{c}{2R} \sqrt{(m \pi)^2 + (n \pi)^2}
   \]

   where \(R\) is the radius of the sphere, and \(m\) and \(n\) are integer mode numbers.

#### Radiation Theory

**Electromagnetic Radiation:**

1. **Radiation from Accelerating Charges:**

   Accelerating charges emit electromagnetic radiation, which can be described by the Larmor formula for non-relativistic charges:

   \[
   P = \frac{e^2 a^2}{6 \pi \epsilon_0 c^3}
   \]

   where \(P\) is the power radiated, \(e\) is the charge, \(a\) is the acceleration, and \(c\) is the speed of light.

2. **Dipole Radiation:**

   For a time-harmonic dipole moment \(\mathbf{p}(t) = \mathbf{p}_0 e^{-i \omega t}\), the far-field radiation pattern is:

   \[
   \mathbf{E} = \frac{\mu_0 \omega^2 \mathbf{p}_0 \times \hat{r}}{4 \pi \epsilon_0 c^2 r} \left( \frac{1 - i kr}{kr} \right)
   \]

   where \(\hat{r}\) is the unit vector in the direction of observation, and \(r\) is the distance from the dipole.

### Relativistic Electrodynamics

#### Covariant Formulation

**Four-Dimensional Formulation:**

In special relativity, electromagnetism is described in four-dimensional spacetime. The electromagnetic field is represented by the antisymmetric field tensor \(F^{\mu \nu}\), which combines electric and magnetic fields.

1. **Field Tensor:**

   \[
   F^{\mu \nu} = \begin{pmatrix}
   0 & -E_x/c & -E_y/c & -E_z/c \\
   E_x/c & 0 & -B_z & B_y \\
   E_y/c & B_z & 0 & -B_x \\
   E_z/c & -B_y & B_x & 0
   \end{pmatrix}
   \]

2. **Maxwell's Equations in Covariant Form:**

   \[
   \partial_\mu F^{\mu \nu} = \mu_0 J^\nu
   \]

   where \(J^\nu\) is the four-current.

**Lorentz Transformations:**

1. **Effect on Fields:**

   The electric and magnetic fields transform between different inertial frames according to Lorentz transformations. For instance, the electric field component in the \(x\)-direction transforms as:

   \[
   E_x' = \gamma (E_x - v B_y)
   \]

   and the magnetic field component in the \(z\)-direction transforms as:

   \[
   B_z' = \gamma (B_z - \frac{v}{c^2} E_x)
   \]

   where \(v\) is the relative velocity between the frames and \(\gamma\) is the Lorentz factor.

#### Charged Particle Dynamics

**Motion in Electromagnetic Fields:**

1. **Relativistic Dynamics:**

   The motion of a charged particle in electric and magnetic fields is described by the relativistic Lorentz force law:

   \[
   \mathbf{F} = q (\mathbf{E} + \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B})
   \]

   where \(\mathbf{F}\) is the force, \(q\) is the charge, \(\mathbf{v}\) is the velocity, and \(\mathbf{E}\) and \(\mathbf{B}\) are the electric and magnetic fields.

2. **Synchrotron Radiation:**

   Relativistic particles moving in a magnetic field emit synchrotron radiation. The power radiated is given by:

   \[
   P = \frac{e^4 \gamma^4 B^2}{6 \pi \epsilon_0 m^4 c^3} \left( \frac{\omega}{c} \right)^2
   \]

   where \(\gamma\) is the Lorentz factor, \(B\) is the magnetic field strength, and \(m\) is the mass of the particle.

### Advanced Electromagnetic Theory

#### Gauge Theories

**Gauge Invariance:**

1. **Local Gauge Invariance:**

   Gauge theories are based on the principle that physical laws should remain invariant under local transformations. For electromagnetism, this is related to the U(1) gauge symmetry, where the gauge field is the electromagnetic field \(A_\mu\).

2. **Yang-Mills Theories:**

   Yang-Mills theories generalize gauge invariance to non-Abelian gauge groups (e.g., SU(2) for the weak force). The field strength tensor \(F_{\mu \nu}^a\) for non-Abelian gauge fields is:

   \[
   F_{\mu \nu}^a = \partial_\mu A_\nu^a - \partial_\nu A_\mu^a + g f^{abc} A_\mu^b A_\nu^c
   \]

   where \(g\) is the coupling constant and \(f^{abc}\) are the structure constants of the gauge group.

#### Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking

**Higgs Mechanism:**

1. **Generating Masses:**

   The Higgs mechanism explains how gauge bosons and fermions acquire mass. The Higgs field \(\phi\) has a non-zero vacuum expectation value, leading to:

   \[
   \mathcal{L} = \frac{1}{2} (\partial_\mu \phi)^2 - \frac{1}{2} m_\phi^2 \phi^2 - \frac{1}{4} g^2 (\phi^\dagger \phi)^2
   \]

   where \(m_\phi\) is the mass of the Higgs boson, and \(g\) is the coupling constant. The symmetry breaking term \( \frac{

1}{4} g^2 (\phi^\dagger \phi)^2 \) gives mass to the gauge bosons.

### Applications and Computational Methods

#### Numerical Solutions

**Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) Method:**

1. **Numerical Technique:**

   The FDTD method is a numerical approach to solving Maxwell's equations by discretizing both time and space. The field values are updated iteratively using:

   \[
   \mathbf{E}_{i,j,k}^{n+1} = \mathbf{E}_{i,j,k}^n + \frac{\Delta t}{\epsilon_0 \Delta x} (\mathbf{B}_{i,j,k}^{n} - \mathbf{B}_{i,j,k}^{n-1})
   \]

   \[
   \mathbf{B}_{i,j,k}^{n+1} = \mathbf{B}_{i,j,k}^n - \frac{\Delta t}{\mu_0 \Delta x} (\mathbf{E}_{i,j,k+1} - \mathbf{E}_{i,j,k-1})
   \]

**Boundary Element Method (BEM):**

1. **Technique for Boundary-Value Problems:**

   BEM is used for solving problems involving boundaries by converting volume integrals into surface integrals. The integral equation is:

   \[
   \int_{\text{surface}} G(\mathbf{r}, \mathbf{r}') \sigma(\mathbf{r}') \, dS' = \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{r})
   \]

   where \(G\) is the Green's function, \(\sigma\) is the surface charge density, and \(\mathbf{f}\) is the field source term.
