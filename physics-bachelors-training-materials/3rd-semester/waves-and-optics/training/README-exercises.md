### Wave Phenomena

#### Wave Properties

1. **Derive the wave equation** for a vibrating string with tension \(T\) and mass per unit length \(\mu\). Use Newton’s second law for a small segment of the string.
   
2. **Solve the one-dimensional wave equation** for a wave traveling to the right with initial conditions: \( \psi(x, 0) = \sin(kx) \) and \( \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t}(x, 0) = 0 \).

3. Two waves are described by \( \psi_1 = A \sin(kx - \omega t) \) and \( \psi_2 = A \sin(kx - \omega t + \phi) \). **Show that their interference pattern** produces a resultant amplitude of \( 2A \cos\left(\frac{\phi}{2}\right) \).

4. In a double-slit experiment, light of wavelength \(600 \, \text{nm}\) passes through slits spaced \(0.2 \, \text{mm}\) apart. **Calculate the distance between adjacent bright fringes** on a screen 2 meters away.

5. For a single slit diffraction pattern, **derive the expression for the angular position** of the first minimum in terms of slit width \(a\) and wavelength \( \lambda \).

#### Types of Waves

6. **Compare transverse and longitudinal waves** by providing examples of each in nature and deriving their respective wave equations.

7. A string of length \(L\) fixed at both ends supports standing waves. **Calculate the frequencies of the first three harmonic modes** if the wave speed on the string is \(v\).

8. **Derive the expression for the speed of a transverse wave** on a string with tension \(T\) and mass per unit length \(\mu\).

9. A longitudinal sound wave in air is described by \( \psi(x, t) = A \sin(kx - \omega t) \). **Calculate the pressure variations** in the wave.

10. **Explain the conditions for the formation of standing waves** on a string and show that the wavelength is related to the string length by \( \lambda_n = \frac{2L}{n} \), where \( n \) is a positive integer.

#### Wave Propagation

11. **Derive the group velocity** and phase velocity for a wave packet described by a superposition of waves with slightly different frequencies.

12. For a dispersive medium where the relationship between frequency and wave number is \( \omega = \sqrt{k^2 + k_0^2} \), **calculate the group velocity** and determine if it exceeds the phase velocity.

13. A wave has a phase velocity of \(v_p = 2 \, \text{m/s}\) and a group velocity of \(v_g = 1.5 \, \text{m/s}\). **Describe a physical situation** where this occurs and explain its implications for wave packets.

14. **Demonstrate that the wave number \(k\) and frequency \( \omega \)** for a non-dispersive wave satisfy the relation \( \omega = v k \), where \(v\) is the wave speed.

15. **Calculate the spread of a wave packet** over time for a dispersive wave where the dispersion relation is \( \omega = k^2 \). How does the width of the packet evolve?
