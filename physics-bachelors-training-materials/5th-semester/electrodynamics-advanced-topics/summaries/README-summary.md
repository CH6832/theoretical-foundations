  - **Mathematical Formulation:**
    The wave equation for the electric field \( \mathbf{E} \) in a medium with permittivity \( \epsilon \) and permeability \( \mu \) is:
    \[
    \nabla^2 \mathbf{E} - \mu \epsilon \frac{\partial^2 \mathbf{E}}{\partial t^2} = \mu \frac{\partial \mathbf{J}}{\partial t} + \nabla (\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E}) - \mu \frac{\partial^2 \mathbf{P}}{\partial t^2}
    \]
    where \( \mathbf{J} \) is the current density and \( \mathbf{P} \) is the polarization.
