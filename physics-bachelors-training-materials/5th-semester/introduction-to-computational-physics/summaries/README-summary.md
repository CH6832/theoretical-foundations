# Introduction to Computational Physics

## Course Description

This course introduces students to computational techniques and methods used to solve complex problems in physics. Emphasis is placed on fundamental algorithms, numerical methods, and simulation techniques essential for analyzing physical systems. Through practical exercises and projects, students will gain hands-on experience with computational tools and approaches.

## Key Topics

### Fundamental Computational Techniques

#### Numerical Methods

**Root-Finding Algorithms:**

1. **Newton-Raphson Method:**

   The Newton-Raphson method is an iterative technique for finding the roots of a function \( f(x) = 0 \). The formula for updating guesses is:

   \[
   x_{n+1} = x_n - \frac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)}
   \]

   where \( f'(x) \) is the derivative of \( f(x) \). The method converges quadratically if the initial guess is sufficiently close to the root.

2. **Bisection Method:**

   The bisection method finds the root of a function by repeatedly halving an interval and selecting subintervals in which the function changes sign. The steps are:

   \[
   x_{\text{mid}} = \frac{a + b}{2}
   \]

   where \( f(a) \) and \( f(b) \) have opposite signs, and the interval \([a, b]\) is updated based on the sign of \( f(x_{\text{mid}}) \).

**Interpolation and Extrapolation:**

1. **Lagrange Interpolation:**

   The Lagrange interpolation polynomial \( P(x) \) is:

   \[
   P(x) = \sum_{i=0}^{n} y_i \prod_{\substack{0 \le j \le n \\ j \ne i}} \frac{x - x_j}{x_i - x_j}
   \]

   where \( \{(x_i, y_i)\} \) are known data points. This polynomial passes through all the given data points.

2. **Least Squares Fitting:**

   For fitting a model to data, such as a linear model \( y = mx + c \), the least squares method minimizes the sum of squared residuals:

   \[
   \text{SSE} = \sum_{i=1}^N (y_i - (mx_i + c))^2
   \]

   where \( \text{SSE} \) is the sum of squared errors.

#### Differential Equations

**Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs):**

1. **Euler’s Method:**

   Euler’s method provides an approximate solution to ODEs of the form \( \frac{dy}{dt} = f(t, y) \) using:

   \[
   y_{n+1} = y_n + h f(t_n, y_n)
   \]

   where \( h \) is the step size. The method is straightforward but may require small step sizes for accuracy.

2. **Runge-Kutta Methods:**

   The fourth-order Runge-Kutta method (RK4) is more accurate and involves:

   \[
   k_1 = h f(t_n, y_n)
   \]
   \[
   k_2 = h f(t_n + \frac{h}{2}, y_n + \frac{k_1}{2})
   \]
   \[
   k_3 = h f(t_n + \frac{h}{2}, y_n + \frac{k_2}{2})
   \]
   \[
   k_4 = h f(t_n + h, y_n + k_3)
   \]
   \[
   y_{n+1} = y_n + \frac{1}{6} (k_1 + 2k_2 + 2k_3 + k_4)
   \]

   This method provides higher accuracy with a fixed step size.

**Partial Differential Equations (PDEs):**

1. **Finite Difference Method:**

   For solving PDEs, such as the heat equation \( \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = \alpha \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} \), the finite difference method discretizes the spatial and temporal derivatives:

   \[
   \frac{u_{i}^{n+1} - u_{i}^n}{\Delta t} = \alpha \frac{u_{i+1}^n - 2u_{i}^n + u_{i-1}^n}{(\Delta x)^2}
   \]

   where \( \Delta t \) and \( \Delta x \) are the time and space step sizes.

2. **Finite Element Method:**

   The finite element method divides the domain into smaller elements and uses interpolation functions to approximate the solution. For a problem involving the Laplace equation \( \nabla^2 u = 0 \), the weak form is:

   \[
   \int_{\Omega} \nabla u \cdot \nabla v \, d\Omega = 0
   \]

   where \( \Omega \) is the domain, \( u \) is the solution, and \( v \) is a test function.

### Computational Simulations

#### Monte Carlo Methods

**Random Number Generation:**

1. **Uniform Distribution:**

   Random numbers can be generated using algorithms such as the Mersenne Twister. For a uniform distribution in the interval \([0, 1]\), the algorithm provides numbers \( r \) with:

   \[
   r \in [0, 1]
   \]

   and can be scaled to other intervals.

2. **Statistical Analysis:**

   Monte Carlo methods use random sampling to estimate quantities such as averages and variances. For example, to estimate the mean of a random variable \( X \):

   \[
   \hat{\mu} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N X_i
   \]

   where \( N \) is the number of samples.

**Molecular Dynamics:**

1. **Simulation of Particles:**

   Molecular dynamics simulations involve calculating the forces and updating the positions and velocities of particles using:

   \[
   \mathbf{F}_i = -\nabla V(\mathbf{r}_i)
   \]
   \[
   \mathbf{r}_{i}^{n+1} = \mathbf{r}_i^n + \mathbf{v}_i^n \Delta t + \frac{1}{2} \mathbf{F}_i^n \Delta t^2 / m_i
   \]
   \[
   \mathbf{v}_{i}^{n+1} = \mathbf{v}_i^n + \frac{1}{2} \left(\mathbf{F}_i^n + \mathbf{F}_i^{n+1}\right) \Delta t / m_i
   \]

   where \( \mathbf{F}_i \) is the force on particle \( i \), \( \mathbf{r}_i \) is its position, \( \mathbf{v}_i \) is its velocity, and \( m_i \) is its mass.

2. **Thermodynamic Properties:**

   Properties such as temperature \( T \) and pressure \( P \) are calculated from simulation data using:

   - **Temperature:**

     \[
     k_B T = \frac{1}{3N} \sum_{i=1}^N m_i v_i^2
     \]

   - **Pressure:**

     \[
     P = \frac{Nk_B T}{V} + \frac{1}{3V} \sum_{i=1}^N \mathbf{F}_i \cdot \mathbf{r}_i
     \]

   where \( k_B \) is the Boltzmann constant and \( V \) is the volume.

### Advanced Topics

**Parallel Algorithms:**

1. **Task Decomposition:**

   Tasks are divided among multiple processors to improve efficiency. Common approaches include:

   - **Domain Decomposition:** Dividing the computational domain into subdomains.
   - **Task Decomposition:** Breaking down the problem into independent tasks.

2. **Communication:**

   Efficient communication between processors is crucial. Techniques such as message passing (MPI) and shared memory (OpenMP) are used.

**High-Performance Computing (HPC):**

1. **HPC Resources:**

   Utilization of supercomputers and clusters involves parallel processing and distributed computing. HPC systems often include thousands of cores and vast memory resources.

2. **Performance Optimization:**

   Techniques for optimizing performance include:

   - **Load Balancing:** Distributing work evenly across processors.
   - **Vectorization:** Using SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) instructions to perform operations on multiple data points simultaneously.
