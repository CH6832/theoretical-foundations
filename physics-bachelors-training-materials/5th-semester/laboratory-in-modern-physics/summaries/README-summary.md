## Key Topics

### **Quantum Mechanics Experiments**

#### **Wave-Particle Duality**

- **Double-Slit Experiment:**

  - **Concept:**
    The double-slit experiment demonstrates the wave-particle duality of light and particles. When particles like electrons or photons pass through two slits, they create an interference pattern on a screen, indicative of their wave-like properties.

  - **Mathematical Explanation:**
    The intensity \( I \) of the interference pattern is given by:
    \[
    I(\theta) = I_0 \left[1 + \cos\left(\frac{2\pi d \sin \theta}{\lambda}\right)\right]
    \]
    where \( I_0 \) is the maximum intensity, \( d \) is the distance between the slits, \( \theta \) is the angle of observation, and \( \lambda \) is the wavelength of the light or particles.

  - **Experimental Setup:**
    A coherent light source or electron gun illuminates a barrier with two slits, and the resulting pattern is projected onto a detector screen. Students measure fringe spacing and intensity to analyze wave-particle duality.

  - **Data Analysis:**
    Measure the spacing between interference fringes and use the above formula to determine the wavelength. Analyze deviations from theoretical predictions to discuss the nature of quantum interference.

- **Photoelectric Effect:**

  - **Concept:**
    The photoelectric effect demonstrates the particle nature of light by showing that light can eject electrons from a material when its frequency exceeds a certain threshold.

  - **Mathematical Explanation:**
    The kinetic energy \( K \) of emitted electrons is given by:
    \[
    K = h\nu - \phi
    \]
    where \( h \) is Planck's constant, \( \nu \) is the frequency of the incident light, and \( \phi \) is the work function of the material.

  - **Mathematical Explanation:**
    The Bell inequality, such as the CHSH (Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt) form, can be expressed as:
    \[
    S = |E(\theta_1, \phi_1) - E(\theta_1, \phi_2) + E(\theta_2, \phi_1) + E(\theta_2, \phi_2)|
    \]
    where \( E(\theta_i, \phi_j) \) are the correlation functions for different measurement angles \( \theta_i \) and \( \phi_j \). Quantum mechanics predicts that \( S \) can exceed the classical limit of 2.
