## Preface

*The preface provides an overview of the book, its objectives, and its target audience. It also explains the structure of the content and how to best utilize the book.*

## Part 1: Vectors

### Chapter 1: Vectors

#### Introduction to Vectors

Vectors are fundamental elements in both linear algebra and machine learning. A vector can be thought of as an ordered list of numbers, represented in a column or row. For example, a vector \(\mathbf{v} \in \mathbb{R}^n\) is denoted as:
\[
\mathbf{v} = \begin{bmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \\ \vdots \\ v_n \end{bmatrix}
\]
where each \(v_i\) is a scalar and \(n\) represents the dimension of the vector.

#### Vector Addition

The addition of two vectors \(\mathbf{v}, \mathbf{w} \in \mathbb{R}^n\) is performed component-wise:
\[
\mathbf{v} + \mathbf{w} = \begin{bmatrix} v_1 + w_1 \\ v_2 + w_2 \\ \vdots \\ v_n + w_n \end{bmatrix}
\]
This operation is commutative and associative, meaning that \(\mathbf{v} + \mathbf{w} = \mathbf{w} + \mathbf{v}\) and \((\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v}) + \mathbf{w} = \mathbf{u} + (\mathbf{v} + \mathbf{w})\).

#### Scalar-Vector Multiplication

Scalar multiplication involves multiplying a vector by a scalar \(c \in \mathbb{R}\):
\[
c\mathbf{v} = \begin{bmatrix} c v_1 \\ c v_2 \\ \vdots \\ c v_n \end{bmatrix}
\]
This operation scales the vector, preserving its direction if \(c > 0\) and reversing it if \(c < 0\).

#### Inner Product

The inner product (or dot product) of two vectors \(\mathbf{v}, \mathbf{w} \in \mathbb{R}^n\) is given by:
\[
\mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{w} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} v_i w_i
\]
The inner product measures the cosine of the angle between the two vectors when normalized and is central to many operations in linear algebra, such as calculating vector projections.

#### Complexity of Vector Computations

The complexity of basic vector operations is linear with respect to the dimension \(n\). For example, the complexity of vector addition or scalar multiplication is \(O(n)\) because each element requires a constant number of operations.

#### Exercises

1. Prove that vector addition is commutative and associative.  
2. Compute the inner product of the vectors \(\mathbf{v} = \begin{bmatrix} 2 \\ 3 \end{bmatrix}\) and \(\mathbf{w} = \begin{bmatrix} 4 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}\).

### Chapter 2: Linear Functions

#### Linear Functions

A linear function \(f: \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}\) can be represented as:
\[
f(\mathbf{x}) = \mathbf{a}^\top \mathbf{x} + b
\]
where \(\mathbf{a} \in \mathbb{R}^n\) is a vector of coefficients, \(\mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^n\) is the input vector, and \(b \in \mathbb{R}\) is a scalar (often referred to as the bias).

#### Taylor Approximation

The first-order Taylor approximation of a function \(f(\mathbf{x})\) around a point \(\mathbf{x}_0\) is given by:
\[
f(\mathbf{x}) \approx f(\mathbf{x}_0) + \nabla f(\mathbf{x}_0)^\top (\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}_0)
\]
where \(\nabla f(\mathbf{x}_0)\) is the gradient of \(f\) at \(\mathbf{x}_0\). This approximation is fundamental in linear regression and optimization.

#### Exercises

1. Given \(f(\mathbf{x}) = 3x_1 + 2x_2 - 5\), find the value of \(f(\mathbf{v})\) for \(\mathbf{v} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \end{bmatrix}\).

### Chapter 3: Norm and Distance

#### Norm

The norm of a vector \(\mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^n\) is a measure of its length or magnitude. The most common norm is the Euclidean norm (or 2-norm), defined as:
\[
\|\mathbf{x}\|_2 = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i^2}
\]
This norm satisfies the properties of positivity, scalability, and the triangle inequality.

#### Distance

The distance between two vectors \(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y} \in \mathbb{R}^n\) using the Euclidean norm is:
\[
d(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y}) = \|\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{y}\|_2 = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - y_i)^2}
\]
This distance measure is crucial in clustering algorithms, classification, and optimization problems.

#### Standard Deviation

The standard deviation of a set of points \(\{\mathbf{x}_1, \mathbf{x}_2, \dots, \mathbf{x}_N\}\) in \(\mathbb{R}^n\) is computed as:
\[
\sigma = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \|\mathbf{x}_i - \mu\|_2^2}
\]
where \(\mu = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \mathbf{x}_i\) is the mean vector. This measure indicates how much the points deviate from the mean.

a_{21} & a_{22} & \cdots & a_{2m} \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
a_{n1} & a_{n2} & \cdots & a_{nm}
