# Lecture Notes on Electrostatics, Magnetostatics, and Electrodynamics

## Electrostatics

### Electric Fields and Potentials

#### Coulomb's Law

**Definition:** Coulomb's Law quantifies the electrostatic force between two point charges. It states that the magnitude of the force \( F \) between two charges \( q_1 \) and \( q_2 \) separated by a distance \( r \) is:

$F = k_e \frac{|q_1 q_2|}{r^2}$

where:

- \( k_e = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \) is Coulomb's constant.
- \( \epsilon_0 \) is the permittivity of free space, approximately \( 8.854 \times 10^{-12} \, \text{F/m} \).

**Explanation:** The force is directly proportional to the product of the magnitudes of the charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. The constant \( k_e \) ensures that the units are consistent and reflects the medium's ability to permit electric field lines.

**Electric Field Concept:**

The electric field \( \mathbf{E} \) due to a point charge \( q \) is:

$\mathbf{E} = k_e \frac{q}{r^2} \hat{r}$

where \( \hat{r} \) is a unit vector pointing radially away from (or towards, if the charge is negative) the charge. 

**Explanation:** The electric field represents the force per unit charge exerted at a point in space due to a source charge. For a positive source charge, the field radiates outward, and for a negative source charge, it converges inward.

#### Gauss's Law

**Definition:** Gauss's Law relates the electric flux through a closed surface to the total charge enclosed within that surface. It is mathematically expressed as:

$\oint_S \mathbf{E} \cdot d\mathbf{A} = \frac{Q_{\text{enc}}}{\epsilon_0}$

where:

- \( \oint_S \mathbf{E} \cdot d\mathbf{A} \) is the electric flux through a closed surface \( S \).
- \( Q_{\text{enc}} \) is the total charge enclosed within the surface.

**Explanation:** The electric flux \( \Phi_E \) through a surface is the integral of the electric field \( \mathbf{E} \) dot the area vector \( d\mathbf{A} \) over the closed surface. Gauss's Law is useful for calculating electric fields in symmetrical charge distributions (spherical, cylindrical, planar).

**Example:** For a spherical Gaussian surface of radius \( r \) centered around a point charge \( Q \), the electric field \( \mathbf{E} \) is radial and constant over the surface:

$\Phi_E = E \cdot 4 \pi r^2 = \frac{Q}{\epsilon_0}$

Solving for \( E \), we get:

$E = \frac{Q}{4 \pi \epsilon_0 r^2}$

#### Electric Potential

**Definition:** The electric potential \( V \) at a point is the work done per unit charge to bring a positive test charge from infinity to that point. For a point charge \( q \), it is:

$V = k_e \frac{q}{r}$

**Explanation:** Electric potential is a scalar quantity that describes the potential energy per unit charge at a point. It simplifies the calculation of work done and potential differences. 

**Potential Difference:** The potential difference \( V_{AB} \) between two points \( A \) and \( B \) is:

$V_{AB} = V_A - V_B = - \int_A^B \mathbf{E} \cdot d\mathbf{l}$

where the integral is taken along a path from \( A \) to \( B \).

**Explanation:** This formula calculates the work done to move a charge from point \( A \) to point \( B \) in an electric field. If the field is uniform, this simplifies to \( V_{AB} = - E \cdot d \), where \( d \) is the distance between \( A \) and \( B \) in the direction of the field.

**Equipotential Surfaces:** These are surfaces where the electric potential \( V \) is constant. No work is done when moving a charge along an equipotential surface because the potential difference is zero.

## Conductors and Dielectrics

### Capacitance

**Definition:** Capacitance \( C \) measures a capacitor's ability to store charge per unit potential difference:

$C = \frac{Q}{V}$

where \( Q \) is the charge stored and \( V \) is the potential difference.

**Explanation:** A capacitor consists of two conductive plates separated by an insulating material (dielectric). The capacitance depends on the area of the plates \( A \), the distance between them \( d \), and the dielectric constant \( \kappa \):

$C = \kappa \frac{\epsilon_0 A}{d}$

**Energy Storage:** The energy \( U \) stored in a capacitor is:

$U = \frac{1}{2} C V^2$

**Explanation:** This energy represents the work done to charge the capacitor. It can be derived from integrating the work done to assemble the charge incrementally on the capacitor plates.

**Dielectrics:** When a dielectric material is inserted between the plates of a capacitor, it increases the capacitance by a factor \( \kappa \), the dielectric constant:

$C' = \kappa C$

**Explanation:** The dielectric reduces the electric field within the capacitor for a given charge, thus increasing the capacitance. Dielectrics are characterized by their ability to polarize in response to an electric field, which reduces the effective field between the plates.

### Polarization

**Definition:** Polarization \( \mathbf{P} \) is the alignment of dipole moments within a dielectric material in an external electric field \( \mathbf{E} \):

$\mathbf{P} = \epsilon_0 (\kappa - 1) \mathbf{E}$

**Explanation:** Polarization describes the extent to which the dielectric material's positive and negative charges are separated due to the external electric field. This separation creates an internal electric field opposing the applied field, affecting the overall electric field within the material.

## Magnetostatics

### Magnetic Fields and Forces

#### Biot-Savart Law

**Definition:** The Biot-Savart Law calculates the magnetic field \( d\mathbf{B} \) at a point due to a small segment \( d\mathbf{l} \) of a current-carrying wire:

$d\mathbf{B} = \frac{\mu_0}{4 \pi} \frac{I d\mathbf{l} \times \hat{r}}{r^2}$

where:

- \( I \) is the current through the segment \( d\mathbf{l} \).
- \( \hat{r} \) is the unit vector from the segment to the point where the field is measured.
- \( \mu_0 \) is the permeability of free space, approximately \( 4 \pi \times 10^{-7} \, \text{H/m} \).

**Explanation:** The Biot-Savart Law describes how the magnetic field is generated by a current element. The direction of \( \mathbf{B} \) is given by the right-hand rule: if the thumb of the right hand points in the direction of the current, the curl of the fingers shows the direction of \( \mathbf{B} \).

#### Ampère's Law

**Definition:** Ampère's Law relates the line integral of the magnetic field \( \mathbf{B} \) around a closed loop to the current \( I_{\text{enc}} \) passing through the loop:

$\oint_C \mathbf{B} \cdot d\mathbf{l} = \mu_0 I_{\text{enc}}$

**Explanation:** This law is analogous to Gauss's Law for electric fields but for magnetic fields. It is useful for calculating the magnetic field in situations with high symmetry, such as infinitely long straight wires or toroids.

### Magnetic Materials

**Magnetization:** The magnetization \( \mathbf{M} \) represents the magnetic moment per unit volume in a material. In the presence of an external magnetic field \( \mathbf{H} \), the relationship is:

$\mathbf{B} = \mu_0 (\mathbf{H} + \mathbf{M})$

where \( \mathbf{B} \) is the magnetic flux density, and \( \mu_0 \) is the permeability of free space.

**Explanation:** Magnetization occurs when a material responds to an external magnetic field by aligning its magnetic dipoles. The magnetic flux density \( \mathbf{B} \) combines the external field \( \mathbf{H} \) and the field generated by the material’s magnetization \( \mathbf{M} \).

## Electrodynamics

### Maxwell's Equations

**Differential Form:**

1. **Gauss's Law for Electricity:**

   $\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} = \frac{\rho}{\epsilon_0}$

   **Explanation:** This law states that the divergence of the electric field \( \mathbf{E} \) at a point is proportional to the

 charge density \( \rho \) at that point. It reflects how charges create electric fields.

2. **Gauss's Law for Magnetism:**

   $\nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = 0$

   **Explanation:** This indicates that there are no magnetic monopoles; the net magnetic flux out of any closed surface is zero, implying magnetic field lines are always closed loops.

3. **Faraday's Law of Induction:**

   $\nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t}$

   **Explanation:** This law describes how a changing magnetic field induces an electric field. The curl of the electric field is equal to the negative rate of change of the magnetic field.

4. **Ampère's Law with Maxwell's Addition:**

   $\nabla \times \mathbf{B} = \mu_0 \mathbf{J} + \mu_0 \epsilon_0 \frac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t}$

   **Explanation:** This law relates the curl of the magnetic field \( \mathbf{B} \) to the current density \( \mathbf{J} \) and the rate of change of the electric field. Maxwell’s addition (the displacement current term) accounts for the time-varying electric fields in changing electromagnetic scenarios.

**Integral Form:**

1. **Gauss's Law for Electricity:**

   $\oint_S \mathbf{E} \cdot d\mathbf{A} = \frac{Q_{\text{enc}}}{\epsilon_0}$

   **Explanation:** This integral form is used to calculate the electric flux through a closed surface, related directly to the enclosed charge.

2. **Gauss's Law for Magnetism:**

   $\oint_S \mathbf{B} \cdot d\mathbf{A} = 0$

   **Explanation:** This integral form confirms the absence of magnetic monopoles, indicating that the magnetic field lines are continuous and closed.

3. **Faraday's Law of Induction:**

   $\oint_C \mathbf{E} \cdot d\mathbf{l} = - \frac{d}{dt} \int_S \mathbf{B} \cdot d\mathbf{A}$

   **Explanation:** This relates the electromotive force around a closed loop to the rate of change of magnetic flux through a surface bounded by the loop.

4. **Ampère's Law with Maxwell's Addition:**

   $\oint_C \mathbf{B} \cdot d\mathbf{l} = \mu_0 \left( \int_S \mathbf{J} \cdot d\mathbf{A} + \epsilon_0 \frac{d}{dt} \int_S \mathbf{E} \cdot d\mathbf{A} \right)$

   **Explanation:** This form links the magnetic field around a closed path to both the enclosed current and the displacement current (rate of change of electric flux).

### Electromagnetic Waves

**Wave Equation:** The electric field \( \mathbf{E} \) and magnetic field \( \mathbf{B} \) propagate as waves in free space. The wave equations are:

$\nabla^2 \mathbf{E} - \frac{1}{c^2} \frac{\partial^2 \mathbf{E}}{\partial t^2} = 0$

$\nabla^2 \mathbf{B} - \frac{1}{c^2} \frac{\partial^2 \mathbf{B}}{\partial t^2} = 0$

where \( c \) is the speed of light in a vacuum:

$c = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\mu_0 \epsilon_0}}$

**Explanation:** These equations describe how electric and magnetic fields propagate as waves through space. The speed of light \( c \) in a vacuum is derived from the fundamental constants \( \mu_0 \) and \( \epsilon_0 \), indicating the interdependence of electric and magnetic fields in electromagnetic waves.

### Electromagnetic Applications

**Waveguides and Resonators:** These are structures designed to guide or resonate electromagnetic waves. Analysis involves solving Maxwell's equations with boundary conditions specific to the shape and material properties of the waveguide or resonator.

**Radiation:** Radiation theory involves understanding how oscillating charges emit electromagnetic waves. Key principles include:

- **Larmor Formula:** Describes the power radiated by an accelerating charge.
- **Antenna Theory:** Analyzes how antennas emit and receive electromagnetic waves, including concepts such as radiation patterns and impedance.
