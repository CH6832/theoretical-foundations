# Newtonian Mechanics

## Fundamental Principles

### Newton’s Laws of Motion

**Newton’s First Law**: An object will remain at rest or in uniform motion in a straight line unless acted upon by a net external force.

Mathematically, this is expressed as:
\[ \mathbf{F}_{\text{net}} = 0 \implies \text{constant velocity} \]

**Newton’s Second Law**: The acceleration$\mathbf{a}$of an object is directly proportional to the net force$\mathbf{F}_{\text{net}}$acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass$m$. This is expressed as:
\[ \mathbf{F}_{\text{net}} = m \mathbf{a} \]

**Newton’s Third Law**: For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. Mathematically:
\[ \mathbf{F}_{A \text{ on } B} = - \mathbf{F}_{B \text{ on } A} \]

### Forces and Dynamics

**Forces**: Common forces include gravitational force$\mathbf{F}_g$, normal force$\mathbf{N}$, frictional force$\mathbf{F}_f$, and tension$\mathbf{T}$.

**Friction**: The frictional force$\mathbf{F}_f$is given by:
\[ \mathbf{F}_f = \mu \mathbf{N} \]
where$\mu$is the coefficient of friction and$\mathbf{N}$is the normal force.

**Dynamics**: To analyze the motion of objects, decompose forces into components and apply Newton's laws to solve for acceleration and resultant motion.

## Kinematics

### Motion in One Dimension

**Displacement, Velocity, and Acceleration**:
- **Displacement**:$\Delta x = x_f - x_i$
- **Velocity**:$v = \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t}$
- **Acceleration**:$a = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t}$

**Kinematic Equations**:
For constant acceleration$a$, the equations of motion are:
\[ v_f = v_i + at \]
\[ \Delta x = v_i t + \frac{1}{2}at^2 \]
\[ v_f^2 = v_i^2 + 2a \Delta x \]

### Motion in Two and Three Dimensions

**Vector Analysis**:
- **Position Vector**:$\mathbf{r} = x \mathbf{i} + y \mathbf{j} + z \mathbf{k}$
- **Velocity Vector**:$\mathbf{v} = \frac{d \mathbf{r}}{dt}$
- **Acceleration Vector**:$\mathbf{a} = \frac{d \mathbf{v}}{dt}$

**Projectile Motion**:
For an object projected with an initial velocity$\mathbf{v}_0$, the horizontal and vertical motions can be analyzed separately:
- **Horizontal Motion**:$x = v_{0x} t$
- **Vertical Motion**:$y = v_{0y} t - \frac{1}{2}gt^2$
where$g$is the acceleration due to gravity.

## Work and Energy

### Work-Energy Theorem

The work done by the net force on an object is equal to the change in its kinetic energy:
\[ W = \Delta K = K_f - K_i \]
where$K = \frac{1}{2} m v^2$is the kinetic energy.

### Conservation of Energy

**Mechanical Energy**: The total mechanical energy$E$is the sum of kinetic energy$K$and potential energy$U$:
\[ E = K + U \]

**Conservation Law**: In an isolated system, the total mechanical energy remains constant:
\[ E_i = E_f \]
where$E_i$and$E_f$are the initial and final total energies, respectively.

## Momentum and Collisions

### Linear Momentum

The linear momentum$\mathbf{p}$of an object is given by:
\[ \mathbf{p} = m \mathbf{v} \]

**Conservation of Momentum**: The total momentum of a system of particles is conserved if no external forces act on it:
\[ \mathbf{p}_{\text{total, initial}} = \mathbf{p}_{\text{total, final}} \]

### Elastic and Inelastic Collisions

**Elastic Collisions**: Both momentum and kinetic energy are conserved. For two objects:
\[ m_1 \mathbf{v}_{1i} + m_2 \mathbf{v}_{2i} = m_1 \mathbf{v}_{1f} + m_2 \mathbf{v}_{2f} \]
\[ \frac{1}{2} m_1 v_{1i}^2 + \frac{1}{2} m_2 v_{2i}^2 = \frac{1}{2} m_1 v_{1f}^2 + \frac{1}{2} m_2 v_{2f}^2 \]

**Inelastic Collisions**: Only momentum is conserved; kinetic energy is not. In a perfectly inelastic collision, the objects stick together

# Newtonian Mechanics

## Fundamental Principles

### Newton’s Laws of Motion

**Newton’s First Law (Law of Inertia)**:
An object will remain at rest or in uniform motion in a straight line unless acted upon by a net external force.

Mathematically, this is expressed as:
\[ \mathbf{F}_{\text{net}} = 0 \implies \text{constant velocity} \]

**Newton’s Second Law (Law of Acceleration)**:
The acceleration$\mathbf{a}$of an object is directly proportional to the net force$\mathbf{F}_{\text{net}}$acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass$m$. This is expressed as:
\[ \mathbf{F}_{\text{net}} = m \mathbf{a} \]

For example, if a car of mass 1000 kg experiences a net force of 4000 N, its acceleration can be calculated as:
\[ \mathbf{a} = \frac{\mathbf{F}_{\text{net}}}{m} = \frac{4000 \, \text{N}}{1000 \, \text{kg}} = 4 \, \text{m/s}^2 \]

**Newton’s Third Law (Action-Reaction Law)**:
For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. Mathematically:
\[ \mathbf{F}_{A \text{ on } B} = - \mathbf{F}_{B \text{ on } A} \]

If a person pushes a wall with a force of 50 N, the wall pushes back with a force of -50 N.

### Forces and Dynamics

**Forces**:
- **Gravitational Force**:$\mathbf{F}_g = m \mathbf{g}$, where$\mathbf{g}$is the acceleration due to gravity ($\approx 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2$on Earth).
- **Normal Force**:$\mathbf{N}$acts perpendicular to the surface.
- **Frictional Force**:$\mathbf{F}_f = \mu \mathbf{N}$, where$\mu$is the coefficient of friction.
- **Tension**: Force transmitted through a string or rope.

**Dynamics**:
To analyze the motion of objects, decompose forces into components and apply Newton's laws:
\[ \Sigma F_x = m a_x \]
\[ \Sigma F_y = m a_y \]
where$\Sigma F_x$and$\Sigma F_y$are the sums of forces in the$x$and$y$directions, respectively.

## Kinematics

### Motion in One Dimension

**Displacement, Velocity, and Acceleration**:
- **Displacement**:$\Delta x = x_f - x_i$, where$x_f$and$x_i$are the final and initial positions.
- **Velocity**:$v = \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t}$, where$\Delta t$is the time interval.
- **Acceleration**:$a = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t}$, where$\Delta v$is the change in velocity.

**Kinematic Equations**:
For constant acceleration$a$:
1.$v_f = v_i + at$
2.$\Delta x = v_i t + \frac{1}{2}at^2$
3.$v_f^2 = v_i^2 + 2a \Delta x$

Example:
If an object starts from rest ($v_i = 0$) and accelerates at$2 \, \text{m/s}^2$for$5$seconds, the final velocity is:
\[ v_f = v_i + at = 0 + (2 \, \text{m/s}^2)(5 \, \text{s}) = 10 \, \text{m/s} \]

### Motion in Two and Three Dimensions

**Vector Analysis**:
- **Position Vector**:$\mathbf{r} = x \mathbf{i} + y \mathbf{j} + z \mathbf{k}$
- **Velocity Vector**:$\mathbf{v} = \frac{d \mathbf{r}}{dt}$
- **Acceleration Vector**:$\mathbf{a} = \frac{d \mathbf{v}}{dt}$

**Projectile Motion**:
For an object projected with initial velocity$\mathbf{v}_0$at an angle$\theta$:
- **Horizontal Motion**:$x = v_{0x} t = v_0 \cos \theta \cdot t$
- **Vertical Motion**:$y = v_{0y} t - \frac{1}{2}gt^2 = v_0 \sin \theta \cdot t - \frac{1}{2} g t^2$

For example, if a projectile is launched with$v_0 = 20 \, \text{m/s}$at$30^\circ$and$g = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2$, the horizontal range$R$is:
\[ R = \frac{v_0^2 \sin 2\theta}{g} = \frac{(20 \, \text{m/s})^2 \sin 60^\circ}{9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2} \approx 40.8 \, \text{m} \]

## Work and Energy

### Work-Energy Theorem

The work done by the net force on an object is equal to the change in its kinetic energy:
\[ W = \Delta K = K_f - K_i \]
where$K = \frac{1}{2} m v^2$is the kinetic energy.

Example:
If a net force of$500 \, \text{N}$does work on an object to increase its velocity from$10 \, \text{m/s}$to$20 \, \text{m/s}$, the work done is:
\[ \Delta K = \frac{1}{2} m (v_f^2 - v_i^2) = \frac{1}{2} m \left[(20^2 - 10^2)\right] =  \frac{1}{2} m (400 - 100) \]

### Conservation of Energy

**Mechanical Energy**: The total mechanical energy$E$is the sum of kinetic energy$K$and potential energy$U$:
\[ E = K + U \]

**Conservation Law**: In an isolated system, the total mechanical energy remains constant:
\[ E_i = E_f \]
where$E_i$and$E_f$are the initial and final total energies.

Example:
For an object in free fall, the sum of potential and kinetic energy remains constant if air resistance is negligible.

## Momentum and Collisions

### Linear Momentum

The linear momentum$\mathbf{p}$of an object is given by:
\[ \mathbf{p} = m \mathbf{v} \]

**Conservation of Momentum**: The total momentum of a system of particles is conserved if no external forces act on it:
\[ \mathbf{p}_{\text{total, initial}} = \mathbf{p}_{\text{total, final}} \]

Example:
In a collision between two cars, if car A has a mass of$1000 \, \text{kg}$and velocity$10 \, \text{m/s}$, and car B has a mass of$1500 \, \text{kg}$and velocity$0 \, \text{m/s}$, the total momentum before collision is:
\[ \mathbf{p}_{\text{total, initial}} = (1000 \times 10) + (1500 \times 0) = 10000 \, \text{kg} \cdot \text{m/s} \]

### Elastic and Inelastic Collisions

**Elastic Collisions**: Both momentum and kinetic energy are conserved. For two objects:
\[ m_1 \mathbf{v}_{1i} + m_2 \mathbf{v}_{2i} = m_1 \mathbf{v}_{1f} + m_2 \mathbf{v}_{2f} \]
\[ \frac{1}{2} m_1 v_{1i}^2 + \frac{1}{2} m_2 v_{2i}^2 = \frac{1}{2} m_1 v_{1f}^2 + \frac{1}{2} m_2 v_{2f}^2 \]

**Inelastic Collisions**: Only momentum is conserved; kinetic energy is not. In a perfectly inelastic collision, the objects stick together:
\[ m_1 \mathbf{v}_{1i} + m_2 \mathbf{v}_{2i} = (m_1 + m_2) \mathbf{v}_f \]

## Rotational Mechanics

### Rotation about a Fixed Axis

**Angular Velocity and Acceleration**:
- **Angular Velocity**:$\omega = \frac{d \theta}{dt}$
- **Angular Acceleration**:$\alpha = \frac{d \omega}{dt}$

**Torque**:
\[ \tau = r F \sin \theta \

]
where$r$is the lever arm and$\theta$is the angle between the force and the lever arm.

**Example**:
If a force of$10 \, \text{N}$is applied at a distance of$0.5 \, \text{m}$from the axis of rotation, and the angle is$90^\circ$:
\[ \tau = 0.5 \times 10 \times \sin 90^\circ = 5 \, \text{Nm} \]

### Moment of Inertia

The moment of inertia$I$depends on the mass distribution relative to the axis of rotation. For a solid disk of mass$M$and radius$R$rotating about an axis perpendicular to its face through its center:
\[ I = \frac{1}{2} M R^2 \]

**Example**:
For a disk with mass$2 \, \text{kg}$and radius$0.3 \, \text{m}$:
\[ I = \frac{1}{2} \times 2 \times (0.3)^2 = 0.09 \, \text{kg} \cdot \text{m}^2 \]

## Advanced Topics

### Oscillatory Motion

**Simple Harmonic Motion (SHM)**:
A system exhibits SHM if its restoring force is proportional to the displacement:
\[ F = -k x \]
where$k$is the spring constant and$x$is the displacement.

The equation of motion for SHM is:
\[ m \frac{d^2 x}{dt^2} + k x = 0 \]

**Example**:
For a mass$m = 0.5 \, \text{kg}$attached to a spring with$k = 20 \, \text{N/m}$:
The angular frequency$\omega$is:
\[ \omega = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} = \sqrt{\frac{20}{0.5}} = \sqrt{40} \approx 6.32 \, \text{rad/s} \]

**Damped Oscillations**:
Include a damping force$F_d = -b \frac{dx}{dt}$, where$b$is the damping coefficient.

**Forced Oscillations**:
An external force$F(t) = F_0 \cos(\omega t)$drives the system, leading to resonance if$\omega$matches the natural frequency of the system.

### Gravitation

**Newton’s Law of Universal Gravitation**:
The force between two masses$m_1$and$m_2$separated by a distance$r$is:
\[ F = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2} \]
where$G$is the gravitational constant ($6.674 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{N} \cdot \text{m}^2/\text{kg}^2$).

**Gravitational Potential Energy**:
\[ U = -G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r} \]

**Orbits and Kepler’s Laws**:
- **Kepler’s First Law**: Planets move in elliptical orbits with the Sun at one focus.
- **Kepler’s Second Law**: A line segment joining a planet and the Sun sweeps out equal areas during equal intervals of time.
- **Kepler’s Third Law**: The square of the orbital period$T$is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis$a$of its orbit:
  \[ \frac{T^2}{a^3} = \text{constant} \]

**Example**:
For Earth orbiting the Sun, if$a$is the average distance and$T$is the orbital period, then:
\[ \frac{T^2}{a^3} = \frac{4 \pi^2}{G (M_{\text{Sun}} + M_{\text{Earth}})} \]
