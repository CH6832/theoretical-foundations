# Classical Mechanics: Newtonian Mechanics

## Course Description

This course provides an in-depth study of Newtonian mechanics, focusing on the fundamental principles and applications of classical mechanics. It covers topics ranging from the basic laws of motion to more complex systems and problem-solving techniques.

## Key Topics

### Newtonian Mechanics
- **Fundamental Principles:**
  - **Newton’s Laws of Motion:** Understanding and application of the three laws.
  - **Forces and Dynamics:** Analysis of forces, friction, and motion of objects.
- **Kinematics:**
  - **Motion in One Dimension:** Displacement, velocity, and acceleration.
  - **Motion in Two and Three Dimensions:** Vector analysis and projectile motion.
- **Work and Energy:**
  - **Work-Energy Theorem:** Relationship between work done by forces and changes in kinetic energy.
  - **Conservation of Energy:** Applications to various mechanical systems.
- **Momentum and Collisions:**
  - **Linear Momentum:** Conservation and transfer of momentum in collisions.
  - **Elastic and Inelastic Collisions:** Analyzing different types of collisions.
- **Rotational Mechanics:**
  - **Rotation about a Fixed Axis:** Angular velocity, acceleration, and torque.
  - **Moment of Inertia:** Calculation and application to rotational dynamics.

### Advanced Topics
