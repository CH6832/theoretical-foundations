## Course Description

This course provides a comprehensive introduction to the fundamental principles of chemistry. It covers basic concepts such as atomic structure, chemical bonding, stoichiometry, and thermodynamics, as well as practical applications in chemical reactions and solutions. The course aims to build a solid foundation in chemistry through both theoretical understanding and practical problem-solving.

## Key Topics

### Atomic Structure and Periodicity

#### Atoms and Molecules

**Atomic Theory:**

- **Structure of Atoms:**
  An atom consists of a nucleus containing protons and neutrons, surrounded by electrons. The number of protons determines the atomic number \( Z \), and the number of neutrons plus protons determines the atomic mass \( A \):

  $A = Z + N$

  where \( N \) is the number of neutrons.

- **Electron Configurations:**
  Electrons occupy atomic orbitals according to the Aufbau principle, Pauli exclusion principle, and Hund's rule. The electron configuration of an atom is written as:

  $1s^2 2s^2 2p^6 3s^2 3p^6 \ldots$

  where each term represents the number of electrons in a particular orbital.

- **Quantum Numbers:**
  Each electron in an atom is described by four quantum numbers:
  - Principal quantum number (\( n \)): Indicates the energy level.
  - Angular momentum quantum number (\( l \)): Describes the shape of the orbital.
  - Magnetic quantum number (\( m_l \)): Describes the orientation of the orbital.
  - Spin quantum number (\( m_s \)): Describes the spin of the electron.

**Periodic Table:**

- **Trends and Properties:**
  - **Atomic Radius:** Decreases across a period and increases down a group. Calculated as:

    $r = \frac{d}{2}$

    where \( d \) is the distance between the nuclei of two adjacent atoms.

  - **Ionization Energy:** The energy required to remove an electron from an atom. It increases across a period and decreases down a group. The formula for successive ionization energies can be expressed as:

    $\text{IE}_n = \text{IE}_{n-1} + \Delta E$

  - **Electronegativity:** A measure of an atom's ability to attract electrons in a chemical bond. It increases across a period and decreases down a group. The Pauling scale is commonly used for quantifying electronegativity.

#### Chemical Bonding

**Types of Bonds:**

- **Ionic Bonding:**
  Formed between a metal and a non-metal through the transfer of electrons. The lattice energy \( U \) of an ionic compound is given by:

  $U = - \frac{k \cdot Q_1 \cdot Q_2}{r_0}$

  where \( k \) is the Coulomb constant, \( Q_1 \) and \( Q_2 \) are the charges of the ions, and \( r_0 \) is the distance between the ions.

- **Covalent Bonding:**
  Formed between two non-metals through the sharing of electrons. The bond order \( BO \) is:

  $BO = \frac{1}{2} \left( N_b - N_a \right)$

  where \( N_b \) is the number of bonding electrons and \( N_a \) is the number of anti-bonding electrons.

- **Metallic Bonding:**
  Involves a "sea of electrons" that are delocalized and shared among a lattice of metal cations. The properties of metallic bonding include electrical conductivity and malleability.

**Molecular Geometry:**

- **VSEPR Theory:**
  Predicts the geometry of molecules based on the repulsion between electron pairs around a central atom. The general formula for predicting molecular shapes is:

  $\text{AX}_n \text{E}_m$

  where \( \text{A} \) is the central atom, \( \text{X}_n \) are the bonded atoms, and \( \text{E}_m \) are the lone pairs.

  - **Linear:** \( 180^\circ \)
  - **Trigonal Planar:** \( 120^\circ \)
  - **Tetrahedral:** \( 109.5^\circ \)
  - **Trigonal Bipyramidal:** \( 90^\circ \text{ and } 120^\circ \)
  - **Octahedral:** \( 90^\circ \)

### Stoichiometry and Chemical Reactions

#### Stoichiometric Calculations

**Mole Concept:**

- **Avogadro’s Number:**
  \( 1 \text{ mole} = 6.022 \times 10^{23} \text{ particles} \).

- **Molar Mass:**
  The mass of one mole of a substance. For a compound, it is the sum of the atomic masses of the constituent elements, measured in grams per mole (g/mol):

  $M = \sum (n_i \cdot M_i)$

  where \( n_i \) is the number of moles of the \( i \)-th element and \( M_i \) is its atomic mass.

**Chemical Equations:**

- **Balancing Equations:**
  Ensuring the number of atoms for each element is the same on both sides of the equation. For example, the balanced equation for the combustion of methane is:

  $\text{CH}_4 + 2\text{O}_2 \rightarrow \text{CO}_2 + 2\text{H}_2\text{O}$

- **Calculating Reaction Yields:**
  Theoretical yield is the maximum amount of product predicted by stoichiometry, while the actual yield is the amount obtained experimentally. The percent yield is:

  $\text{Percent Yield} = \frac{\text{Actual Yield}}{\text{Theoretical Yield}} \times 100\%$

#### Types of Reactions

**Redox Reactions:**

- **Oxidation and Reduction:**
  Oxidation involves the loss of electrons, while reduction involves the gain of electrons. The change in oxidation states of elements in a reaction indicates electron transfer.

- **Balancing Redox Reactions:**
  Use half-reaction methods to balance redox reactions in acidic or basic solutions.

**Acids and Bases:**

- **Properties and Strength:**
  - **Acids:** Donate protons (\( \text{H}^+ \)). Strong acids completely dissociate in water (e.g., \( \text{HCl} \)).
  - **Bases:** Accept protons (\( \text{OH}^- \)). Strong bases completely dissociate in water (e.g., \( \text{NaOH} \)).

- **Neutralization Reactions:**
  Reactions between an acid and a base to produce water and a salt. The general reaction is:

  $\text{HA} + \text{BOH} \rightarrow \text{BA} + \text{H}_2\text{O}$

### Thermodynamics and Kinetics

#### Thermodynamics

**First Law of Thermodynamics:**

- **Energy Conservation:**
  The total energy of an isolated system is constant. The change in internal energy \( \Delta U \) is related to heat \( q \) and work \( w \):

  $\Delta U = q - w$

**Entropy and Enthalpy:**

- **Enthalpy (\( \Delta H \)):**
  The heat content of a system at constant pressure. For a reaction, it is calculated using:

  $\Delta H = \sum H_{\text{products}} - \sum H_{\text{reactants}}$

- **Entropy (\( \Delta S \)):**
  A measure of disorder or randomness. For a reversible process, the change in entropy is:

  $\Delta S = \frac{\Delta Q_{\text{rev}}}{T}$

  where \( \Delta Q_{\text{rev}} \) is the heat absorbed or released reversibly and \( T \) is the temperature.

- **Gibbs Free Energy (\( \Delta G \)):**
  Predicts spontaneity of a reaction:

  $\Delta G = \Delta H - T \Delta S$

#### Chemical Kinetics

**Reaction Rates:**

- **Factors Affecting Reaction Rate:**
  - Concentration of reactants
  - Temperature
  - Presence of a catalyst

- **Rate Law:**
  The rate of reaction \( r \) is related to the concentration of reactants \( [A] \) and \( [B] \) by:

  $r = k [A]^m [B]^n$

  where \( k \) is the rate constant, and \( m \) and \( n \) are the reaction orders with respect to each reactant.

- **Determining Reaction Orders:**
  Using experimental data to find \( m \) and \( n \) by measuring the effect of changing reactant concentrations on the rate.

### Solutions and Equilibria

#### Solution Chemistry

**Concentration Units:**

- **Molarity (\( M \)):**

  $M

 = \frac{\text{moles of solute}}{\text{liters of solution}}$

- **Molality (\( m \)):**

  $m = \frac{\text{moles of solute}}{\text{kg of solvent}}$

- **Normality (\( N \)):**

  $N = \frac{\text{equivalents of solute}}{\text{liters of solution}}$

**Colligative Properties:**

- **Boiling Point Elevation (\( \Delta T_b \)):**

  $\Delta T_b = i K_b m$

  where \( i \) is the van’t Hoff factor, \( K_b \) is the ebullioscopic constant, and \( m \) is the molality.

- **Freezing Point Depression (\( \Delta T_f \)):**

  $\Delta T_f = i K_f m$

  where \( K_f \) is the cryoscopic constant.

#### Chemical Equilibrium

**Le Chatelier’s Principle:**

- **Shifts in Equilibrium:**
  Changes in concentration, pressure, or temperature can shift the position of equilibrium. For example, adding more reactant will shift the equilibrium to produce more products.

**Equilibrium Constants:**

- **Expression for Equilibrium Constant (\( K_c \)):**

  $K_c = \frac{[\text{products}]}{[\text{reactants}]}$

  where concentrations are raised to the power of their stoichiometric coefficients.
