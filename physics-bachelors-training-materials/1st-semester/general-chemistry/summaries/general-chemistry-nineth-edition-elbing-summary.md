## Introduction to Chemistry

### The Nature of Chemistry
Chemistry is the science that studies matter and its interactions. Matter is anything that has mass and occupies space.

### Scientific Method
The scientific method involves observing, hypothesizing, experimenting, and concluding. This method is iterative and allows for continuous refinement of theories and models.

### Measurement and Units

#### SI Units
The International System of Units (SI) is used to provide a standard measurement system:
- Length: meter (m)
- Mass: kilogram (kg)
- Time: second (s)
- Temperature: Kelvin (K)
- Amount of substance: mole (mol)
- Electric current: ampere (A)
- Luminous intensity: candela (cd)

### Dimensional Analysis
Dimensional analysis involves converting units from one system to another by using conversion factors. For example, to convert 5 meters to centimeters:

$5 \, \text{m} \times \frac{100 \, \text{cm}}{1 \, \text{m}} = 500 \, \text{cm}$

## Atoms, Molecules, and Ions

### Atomic Theory

#### Dalton's Atomic Theory
Dalton's theory posits that:
- All matter is composed of atoms.
- Atoms of a given element are identical.
- Atoms combine in simple whole-number ratios to form compounds.
- Chemical reactions involve the rearrangement of atoms.

### Structure of the Atom

#### Subatomic Particles
- **Protons** (\( p \)): Positively charged particles in the nucleus.
- **Neutrons** (\( n \)): Neutral particles in the nucleus.
- **Electrons** (\( e^- \)): Negatively charged particles orbiting the nucleus.

#### Atomic Number and Mass Number
- **Atomic Number** (\( Z \)): Number of protons in the nucleus.
- **Mass Number** (\( A \)): Sum of protons and neutrons.

### Molecular Structure

#### Chemical Bonds
- **Covalent Bonds**: Atoms share electrons to achieve stability.
- **Ionic Bonds**: Electrons are transferred from one atom to another.

### Ions

#### Formation of Ions
**Cations** are positively charged ions formed by losing electrons:

$\text{Na} \rightarrow \text{Na}^+ + e^-$

**Anions** are negatively charged ions formed by gaining electrons:

$\text{Cl} + e^- \rightarrow \text{Cl}^-$

## Chemical Reactions

### Balancing Chemical Equations
A chemical equation must balance to satisfy the law of conservation of mass. For example:

$\text{2H}_2 + \text{O}_2 \rightarrow \text{2H}_2\text{O}$

This equation shows that 2 molecules of hydrogen react with 1 molecule of oxygen to produce 2 molecules of water.

### Types of Chemical Reactions
- **Synthesis Reactions**: Two or more substances combine to form a new compound.
- **Decomposition Reactions**: A compound breaks down into simpler substances.
- **Single Replacement Reactions**: One element replaces another in a compound.
- **Double Replacement Reactions**: Two compounds exchange ions.
- **Combustion Reactions**: A substance reacts with oxygen, releasing energy.

### Stoichiometry

#### Mole Concept
The mole is a unit that represents \(6.022 \times 10^{23}\) entities (Avogadro's number). For example:

$1 \, \text{mol} \text{ of } \text{H}_2\text{O} \text{ contains } 6.022 \times 10^{23} \text{ molecules}.$

#### Calculations
To find the mass of a substance from moles:

$\text{mass} = \text{moles} \times \text{molar mass}$

where molar mass is the mass of one mole of a substance, expressed in grams per mole (g/mol).

## Solutions

### Solution Concentration

#### Molarity
Molarity (\( M \)) is the concentration of a solution expressed as moles of solute per liter of solution:

$M = \frac{\text{moles of solute}}{\text{liters of solution}}$

#### Dilution
Dilution involves adding solvent to decrease the concentration of a solution. The relationship is:

$M_1V_1 = M_2V_2$

where \( M_1 \) and \( V_1 \) are the molarity and volume of the concentrated solution, and \( M_2 \) and \( V_2 \) are the molarity and volume of the diluted solution.

## Acids and Bases

### Properties of Acids and Bases

#### Acids
Acids are substances that donate protons (\( \text{H}^+ \)) in aqueous solutions. Examples include hydrochloric acid (\( \text{HCl} \)).

#### Bases
Bases are substances that accept protons or donate hydroxide ions (\( \text{OH}^- \)). Examples include sodium hydroxide (\( \text{NaOH} \)).

### pH Scale
The pH of a solution measures its acidity or basicity:

$\text{pH} = -\log[\text{H}^+]$

where \( [\text{H}^+] \) is the concentration of hydrogen ions. The pH scale ranges from 0 to 14, with lower values indicating acidic solutions and higher values indicating basic solutions.

### Buffer Solutions
Buffers resist changes in pH when small amounts of acid or base are added. They consist of a weak acid and its conjugate base, or a weak base and its conjugate acid.

## Thermochemistry

### Heat and Energy

#### Heat
Heat is the energy transferred between objects due to temperature differences. It is measured in joules (J).

#### Enthalpy
Enthalpy (\( H \)) is the heat content of a system. The change in enthalpy (\( \Delta H \)) during a reaction is given by:

$\Delta H = H_{\text{products}} - H_{\text{reactants}}$

### First Law of Thermodynamics
The first law states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed:

$\Delta U = Q - W$

where \( \Delta U \) is the change in internal energy, \( Q \) is the heat added to the system, and \( W \) is the work done by the system.

---

## Chemical Kinetics

### Reaction Rates
Reaction rates measure how quickly reactants are converted into products. The rate law is:

$\text{Rate} = k[A]^m[B]^n$

where \( k \) is the rate constant, and \( m \) and \( n \) are the orders of reaction with respect to reactants \( A \) and \( B \).

### Arrhenius Equation
The Arrhenius equation relates the rate constant to temperature:

$k = A \exp\left(-\frac{E_a}{RT}\right)$

where \( k \) is the rate constant, \( A \) is the pre-exponential factor, \( E_a \) is the activation energy, \( R \) is the gas constant, and \( T \) is the temperature. This equation shows that an increase in temperature or a decrease in activation energy increases the reaction rate.

---

## Chemical Equilibrium

### Equilibrium Constant
The equilibrium constant (\( K \)) expresses the ratio of product concentrations to reactant concentrations at equilibrium:

$K = \frac{[C]^c[D]^d}{[A]^a[B]^b]$

where \( [C] \) and \( [D] \) are the concentrations of products, and \( [A] \) and \( [B] \) are the concentrations of reactants. \( a \), \( b \), \( c \), and \( d \) are the stoichiometric coefficients.

### Le Chatelier's Principle
Le Chatelier's principle states that if a dynamic equilibrium is disturbed, the system will adjust to counteract the disturbance. This principle helps predict the effect of changes in concentration, pressure, and temperature on the equilibrium position.

## Electrochemistry

### Oxidation and Reduction
Oxidation involves the loss of electrons, while reduction involves the gain of electrons. For example:

$\text{Zn} \rightarrow \text{Zn}^{2+} + 2e^-$

$\text{Cu}^{2+} + 2e^- \rightarrow \text{Cu}$

In these reactions, zinc loses electrons (oxidation), and copper gains electrons (reduction).

### Electrochemical Cells

#### Galvanic Cells
Galvanic cells convert chemical energy into electrical energy through spontaneous redox reactions. An example is the Daniell cell, which uses zinc and copper electrodes.

#### Nernst Equation
The Nernst equation relates the cell potential to concentration:

$E = E^\circ - \frac{RT}{nF} \ln Q$

where \( E \) is the cell potential, \( E^\circ \) is the standard cell potential, \( R \) is the gas constant, \( T \) is the temperature in Kelvin, \( n \) is the number of moles of electrons exchanged, \( F \) is Faraday's constant, and \( Q \) is the reaction quotient. This equation helps calculate the cell potential under non-standard conditions.

---

## Chemical Thermodynamics

### Gibbs Free Energy
Gibbs free energy (\( G \)) determines the spontaneity of a reaction:

$\Delta G = \Delta H - T\Delta S$

where \( \Delta G \) is the change in Gibbs free energy, \( \Delta H \) is the change in enthalpy, \( T \) is the temperature in Kelvin, and \( \Delta S \) is the change in entropy. A reaction is spontaneous if \( \Delta G < 0 \).

### Spontaneity and Equilibrium
At equilibrium, the Gibbs free energy change (\( \Delta G \)) is zero, indicating no net change in the concentrations of reactants and products. The condition for spontaneity is \( \Delta G < 0 \).

---

## Quantum Chemistry

### Wave-Particle Duality
Electrons exhibit both wave-like and particle-like properties. The de Broglie wavelength (\( \lambda \)) is given by:

$\lambda = \frac{h}{mv}$

where \( h \) is Planck's constant, \( m \) is the mass, and \( v \) is the velocity. This equation quantifies the wave nature of particles.

### Schrödinger Equation
The Schrödinger equation describes how the quantum state of a physical system changes over time:

$\hat{H} \Psi = E \Psi$

where \( \hat{H} \) is the Hamiltonian operator, \( \Psi \) is the wavefunction, and \( E \) is the energy of the system. This fundamental equation in quantum mechanics provides the basis for understanding atomic and molecular structures.

## Organic Chemistry

### Hydrocarbons

#### Alkanes
Alkanes are saturated hydrocarbons with single bonds. Their general formula is:

$C_nH_{2n+2}$

where \( n \) is the number of carbon atoms.

#### Alkenes and Alkynes
Alkenes and alkynes contain double and triple bonds, respectively. Their general formulas are:
- **Alkenes**: \( C_nH_{2n} \)
- **Alkynes**: \( C_nH_{2n-2} \)

### Functional Groups
Functional groups determine the chemical properties of organic compounds. Examples include:
- **Alcohols** (\(-OH\)): Hydroxyl group attached to a carbon.
- **Carboxylic Acids** (\(-COOH\)): Carboxyl group attached to a carbon.
- **Amines** (\(-NH_2\)): Amino group attached to a carbon.

### Isomerism
Isomers are compounds with the same molecular formula but different structures. Types of isomerism include:
- **Structural Isomerism**: Different connectivity of atoms.
- **Stereoisomerism**: Different spatial arrangement of atoms.
